**Getting Started**
===================

Common and Newbie Questions
---------------------------

Q: What kind of game is *Warframe*?

A: *Warframe* is a 3rd person hack and slash shooter with parkour, with
some RPG and MMO elements. But most people tend to just say space ninjas
with magic.

Q: Is *Warframe* pay-to-win (P2W)? Am I at a disadvantage if I don't
pay/have Platinum (Plat/premium currency)?

A: No, *Warframe* is pay-to-skip. Almost everything in the game is
obtainable without Plat and the rest can be traded for. There are a few
exceptions to this rule, but are mainly cosmetics. You can also trade
items you've found in game for Plat.

Q: My first 50 Plat is untradeable, what gives?

Q: Why do I have untradable Plat?

A: Any starting Platinum will be untradable. This is to prevent account
creation for Plat farming. Most if not all other Plat that you earn will
always be usable for everything, including trading.

It should be noted that any plat gained from DE directly, i.e. from
streams/giveaways/partners, can also not be traded.

Q: What should I use my starting Plat on?

A: Generally, slots, potatoes (orokin reactors/catalysts) then cosmetics
in that order. You'll be able to get more Plat via trading with others
later.

A good choice is 1 Warframe slot (20p) and 2 Weapon slots (12x2=24) Thus
equaling 44 Plat.

Q: Are there any form of dedicated servers?

Q: Any servers in x region?

A: All games played on *Warframe* with the exception of Relays or Clans
(hubs) are hosted peer to peer. If your connection isn't good, generally
as with any kind of connection based game, you will have a hard time.

Q: Is there a solo mode?

A: Technically, everything in the game can be completed solo. In fact,
some do it for a challenge. However, there are some parts of the game
that could necessitate a friend or two, and most missions will
definitely be easier with a fellow Tenno at your side.

Q: Is there a campaign mode?

A: Yes. A few quests (about 6 for the main story) have a campaign, with
story and lore reveals. These are unlocked as you progress through the
game.

Q: Is there an offline mode?

A: Playing 'offline' is impossible. The game will not start without an
internet connection. However, playing pseudo offline is possible, by
playing in solo mode.

Q: Is *Warframe* cross-compatible?

A: No, the game is not cross-compatible. Switching systems will require
the creation of a new account. *Warframe* is currently available on PC,
Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo Switch.

Q: What Warframe should I pick as my starter?

Q: What's the best starter Warframe?

A: Warframes are basically your classes, they have different abilities
that change the way you play the game. As a rule of thumb, none of the
starter Warframes are "better" or "best", they cater to your playstyle.

-   Excalibur or Excal is the Warrior, which likes getting in people's
    > faces, hack n slash.

-   Mag is basically the Mage, using her abilities for nuking, CC (Crowd
    > Control) and utilities.

-   Volt is a Hybrid, that features damaging CC and various utilities
    > (speed/shield).

If you can't choose, go with the one you think looks the coolest.

Q: Can I get the other Warframes if I pick x?

A: Yes, you can get them later in the game.

Q: I just finished the tutorial with Vor, how do I advance through the
game?

A: Complete mission nodes (the flashing blue ones), get to junctions and
finish their goals. Buy weapon and Warframe blueprints from the Market
for Credits.

Q: I'm lost, what should I do?

A: Tons of stuff! You can play missions on different planets, unlocking
nodes. Buy and craft things from the market. Find Quests from Junctions
and play through them. Find mods and fill your mod collection. Search
for Ayatan Treasures and collectibles. Join a clan. Hop on the chats and
find others to get lost with you. Play the game and find out!

Q: Why do the mission levels kinda look the same?

A: *Warframe's* missions are procedurally-generated. The game has a set
number of rooms, called a tileset, that are randomly linked together
every time you start a mission. So the rooms look the same, but the
layout is always different.

Q: What is my level?

A: There are 2 kinds, Mastery level and item level. For Mastery, press
escape, and click on profile. The number on the first page is your
Mastery Level. For item level, go to the Arsenal or press \[ESC\] →
Arsenal and select an item, the level will be under the item's name.

Q: What is Forma?

A: It's used in crafting a variety of items and can add polarities to
weapons.

Q: What is a polarity?

A: See [[Polarities]{.underline}](#polarities)

Q: What is taxi-ing?

A: For players that don't have all the nodes unlocked, a taxi is a
player with that node unlocked, and can host a mission on that node for
up to 3 others. Generally, once a person has taxi'd someone over, they
will leave so that they may taxi others.

Q: What are Syndicates?

A: See [[Syndicates]{.underline}](#_5wtqzdmg5475)

Q: What is a Potato / Orokin Reactor / Orokin Catalyst?

A: They double the amount of mod capacity that your frame (Reactor) or
weapon (Catalyst) has. They are nicknamed potatoes due to their shape.

Q: Until what time can I still invite friends to my missions if I've
started it?

A: Any time the objective hasn't been (partially) finished, depending on
the mode. For example, Exterminates stop invites around a third of
completion through, while endless missions can be invited to about
halfway into the first iteration.

Q: What is this scanner I can click on in my ship?

A: It's basically a space radio, it doesn't do much. It's mostly there
for ambient noise, and bits of lore can be found if you listen closely
enough.

Q: Offline segment? What's that?

A: You haven't unlocked it as part of your ship. Continue playing,
you'll find them gradually as you progress.

Q: Why is my screen/lights flickering?

A: An Assassin or Syndicate is after you. Try to stick with your allies
or warn them so they can help you.

For Assassins, see section [[Assassins]{.underline}](#assassins).

For syndicates, see section [[Syndicates]{.underline}](#_5wtqzdmg5475).

Q: What are these glowing blue hexagons?

Q: What is a Cephalon Fragment?

Q: What is a Somachord Tone?

A: They're scannable items which provide lore (and music!) when
unlocked.

Q: I just got a weapon from a Quest. Should I keep it, or sell it?

A: Keep all items given from Quests due to the fact you will only get
them once.

Your Orbiter is your home, and in-game hub with access to everything in
the game. It includes your Navigation Console, Arsenal, Mod Collection,
Foundry, Stasis Chamber, Relic Console, Market, and Codex.

You navigate your consoles by simply walking up to them, or by using
your Main Menu. You unlock consoles by completing Quests and Mission
Nodes.

**(SPOILERS)** There are 3 back rooms to your ship - The Helminth,
Operator, and Personal Quarters. The Helminth contains the equipment to
remove [[Helminth Cysts]{.underline}](#helminth-cyst), and can only be
accessed by a fully infected Warframe or Nidus. The Operator Room
contains the menus for customizing your Operator and accessing the
[[Focus]{.underline}](#focus) schools. The Personal Quarters is a
decoratable room, and includes the Somachord where you can play music
you've found from Somachord Tones.

All rooms and areas in your Orbiter can be customized, recolored, and
decorated. Consoles cannot be moved.

Movement System
---------------

One of the primary selling points of *Warframe* is its unique, fluid
movement system. You can make your Warframe do a number of parkour
tricks, which can be chained together into what is called the Movement
System.

**Basic elements of movement**

-   \[W\] \[A\] \[S\] \[D\] move up, left, down, right

-   \[SPACE\] to jump

-   \[SHIFT\] to roll/dodge, hold to sprint

-   \[CTRL\] to crouch, hold while moving to slide

-   \[RIGHT MOUSE CLICK\] hold to aim, hold to aim-glide when in
    > mid-air, hold when on a wall to wall latch

-   \[E\] to quick melee, slam attack when in mid-air

**Basic Chained Movement**

Learn these well before attempting Advanced Chain Movement.

-   \[SPACE\] \[SPACE\] to double jump

-   Hold \[CTRL\] then press \[SPACE\] to bullet jump (will fly towards
    > mouse direction)

-   \[SPACE\] \[SHIFT\] to jump then roll forward

-   \[SPACE\] hold \[CTRL\] to jump then slide as you hit the ground

-   Hold \[CTRL\], then press \[SHIFT\] to slide then roll

Note: There is no fall damage, but falling from a great height will
cause you to stagger when you hit the ground. You can avoid this by
rolling or sliding as you touch down, or by using aim-glide or double
jump to slow your descent.

**Advanced Chained Movement**

-   Hold \[CTRL\] then press \[SPACE\] \[SPACE\] to bullet jump, then
    > double jump

Damage
------

### Physical Damage

The main type of damage in *Warframe* is physical damage, split into
three different types - Impact, Puncture, and Slash. It is commonly
referred to as IPS damage. Most weapons and some Warframe abilities have
at least one of these damage types, with the weapons usually having all
3. Each damage type has a Status Effect, also known as a Proc. See
Status below.

### Elemental Damage

The secondary type of damage in *Warframe* is Elemental damage, which is
split into 4 base elements; Heat, Cold, Electric, and Toxin. These
damage types are rarer on weapons, and more common on Warframe
abilities. However, these elements can be added to weapons using mods.

The 4 base elemental types can be combined to create 6 combined
Elemental damage types:

-   Heat + Cold make Blast

-   Electric + Toxin make Corrosive

-   Heat + Toxin make Gas

-   Cold + Electric make Magnetic

-   Heat + Electric make Radiation

-   Cold + Toxin make Viral

All 10 Elemental damage types have a Status Effect, or Proc, that they
can inflict. See Status Below.

### Other Damage

There are two other types of damage usable by the player, True and Void.

True damage is a hidden damage type, and has no damage modifier versus
any kind of health, and it ignores armor reduction and shields. A few
examples of true damage are Finisher attacks and Bleed procs.

Void damage **(SPOILERS)** is only used by Operators and their Amps. It
guarantees stun against drone type Sentients, and ignores Sentient
damage reduction.

### Status

Every damage type has a Status Effect, or Proc, that it can inflict.
These are damage/effect over time and their effectiveness is based on
the base damage of the damage type, and the Status Chance and Status
Duration of the item inflicting damage. No Proc lasts infinitely, except
for Corrosion. The damage type with the highest amount of damage will
always be the most likely to Proc, with lesser damage numbers losing
likeliness as damage lessens. This applies to IPS and Elemental damage
individually, meaning two Procs can occur simultaneously, one physical
and one elemental.

**Physical Damage Procs**

-   Impact - Knockback - Causes enemies to flinch and recoil back.

-   Puncture - Weakened - Cause victim's attacks to deal less damage.

-   Slash - Bleed - Affected victims take damage over time, which also
    > bypasses shield and armor.

**Base Elemental Damage Procs**

-   Heat - Ignite - Sets enemies ablaze and deals damage over time.

-   Cold - Freeze - Reduces victim's movement speed and fire rate.

-   Electric - Tesla Chain - Sends an electric surge through the victim
    > and to all enemies within a 3m radius of the victim, dealing
    > damage over time and stunning.

-   Toxin - Poison - Infects the victim and causes damage over time.
    > This damage bypasses shields.

**Combined Elemental Damage Procs**

-   Blast - Explosive Knockdown - Forces victim and all enemies with a
    > 5m radius of the victim to stumble and fall to the ground.

-   Corrosive - Corrosion - Strips the victim's armor by 25% every proc
    > permanently. This effect can stack exponentially.

-   Gas - Toxic Cloud - Produces a small cloud around the affected
    > victim in a 3m radius that deals Toxin damage. Because it is
    > innate Toxin, it bypasses shields.

-   Magnetic - Disrupt - Reduces victim's current shields and maximum
    > shield capacity by 75%.

-   Radiation - Confusion - Causes the victim to become confused and
    > randomly attack any enemy or ally within range. This also causes
    > their allies to attack them.

-   Viral - Virus - Reduces victim's current and maximum health by 50%.

\*IGN = Ignores on Proc

### Multishot

Multishot is the chance a weapon will fire an extra projectile for no
extra ammo cost. It is widely considered the most powerful damage buff.

Multishot is rated on a percentage scale.

At 50% Multishot, a weapon will always fire one round for every fire
instance, and has a 50% chance of firing 2 rounds.

At 100% Multishot, a weapon will always fire two rounds for every fire
instance.

At 150% Multishot, a weapon will always fire two rounds for every fire
instance, and has a 50% chance to fire 3 rounds.

At 200% Multishot, a weapon will always fire 3 rounds for every fire
instance.

Etc.

Multishot will display an increase in damage stats similar to damage,
but this is "fake" damage based on the chance of firing an extra shot,
and is not the actual damage that can occur.

Multishot will show an increase in Status Chance, but this is 'fake'
Status Chance. If you achieve 100% Status with multishot mods, then that
guaranteed Status Proc applies to ONE shot in the multishot volley. For
Status to apply to all shots, 100% Status Chance is needed BEFORE
multishot is applied.

### Punch Through

Punch Through is a mechanic that can exist in fireable or thrown
weapons. It is the maximum depth of material that a projectile can
penetrate. Once a projectile encounters a surface too thick to
penetrate, it will stop as normal. It is typically given through mods,
but some weapons have innate Punch Through.

Punch Through is rated by punch distance in meters.

-   0.1m of PT is enough to pierce a Shield Lancer's riot shield.

-   1.0m of PT is enough to pierce any openable door, any soft cover,
    > and any small enemy unit.

-   1.2m of PT is enough to pierce through any regular enemy unit, or 2
    > small enemy units.

-   2.1m of PT is enough to pierce through two of any regular enemy
    > unit, or 4 small enemy units.

Punch Through will not work on large or damage-locked bosses, Frost and
Arctic Eximus shields, and Nullifier bubbles. It will also not work on
walls that separate mission tiles, only doors.

Melee 3.0
---------

Other than gunplay, *Warframe* is known for its addictive melee
elements. The current way melee works in the game is referred to as
Melee 3.0. Melee 2.0 was phased out of the game in March of 2019.
Additional patches are set to change the way melee functions.

Melee 2.0 - 3.0 changes:

-   Increased slam attack speed and range of knockdown effect.

-   Removed quick melee animations and replaced the action with instant
    > melee weapon swap and attack.

-   Aiming or firing will re-equip last used primary/secondary weapon
    > instantly, and perform the action.

-   Blocking is now automatic when facing an enemy.

-   Channeling moved to \[ALTERNATE FIRE\] when melee weapon is out.

There are many melee weapon types available for use, all with their own
strengths, weaknesses, and playstyle.

**Melee Weapon Types:**

-   Sword

-   Dual Sword

-   Sword and Shield

-   Dagger

-   Dual Dagger

-   Machete

-   Nikana

-   Rapier

-   Scythe

-   Nunchaku

-   Polearm

-   Stave

-   Heavy Blade

-   Hammer

-   Gunblade

-   Blade and Whip

-   Fist Weapon

-   Sparring Weapon

-   Claw

-   Glaive

-   Tonfa

-   Whip

-   Hybrid

When you have a melee weapon in your loadout, but are wielding your
primary or secondary, you can instantly switch to your melee weapon with
\[E\]. This is good for instant counterattack in close quarters or when
out of ammo. Firing or aiming will re-equip your last weapon.

When your melee weapon is equipped, you can block/parry incoming attacks
and bullets by facing the attacking enemy with your melee weapon out.
You can also channel your energy using \[ALTERNATE FIRE\]. Channeling
provides damage boosts and parrying opportunities, but is rarely used
in-game by most players.

Melee Finisher attacks are a stealth based melee attack. All
unalerted/disoriented/blind/asleep enemies have the option to have a
finisher attack performed on them. Finishers do extremely high damage
when done correctly.

When your melee weapon is equipped, you have access to your Stance Mod.
Stance Mods are rare mods that modify the attack patterns and combos of
your melee weapon. They are equipped in your Upgrade menu, in the
special slot above the regular 8 mod slots. Only one Stance Mod may be
equipped at a time. Keep in mind Stance Mods only work for the weapon
types displayed on their card. So a Sword Stance will not be equippable
on a Rapier, and a Polearm Stance will not be equippable on a Heavy
Blade. Additionally, equipping a Stance Mod will provide extra mod
capacity for the weapon, equal to the amount of drain on the card.

Consecutive melee attacks will build your Melee Combo Counter. The more
hits landed in a short period of time, the higher the damage multiplier
becomes. Not hitting an enemy for a short period will reset the counter.
Mods can be applied that extend the time before the counter resets, such
as Body Count and Drifting Contact.

Affinity
--------

Q: What is Affinity?

A: Affinity is essentially XP. It is not Mastery, however it leads to
Mastery.

Q: How do I get Affinity?

A: When you kill something, complete a mission objective, or complete a
challenge, you will gain Affinity for your equipment. The white bold
number with a plus next to it that appears after killing an enemy or
completing a challenge/objective is the amount of Affinity earned from
that action.

Q: This guy has all the kills, am I not gonna get XP?

A: Don't be sad/angry when someone "killsteals", any Affinity they gain
will also be passed to you as long as you're within 50m of them.

Q: How much Affinity is needed to max something?

A: You need 900k affinity to max a Warframe and 450k to max a weapon
(from unranked to 30).

If an item is maxed with Affinity, it will still gain the Affinity it is
due in missions, but will not go up any more in level.

Q: Does everything get Affinity at the same rate?

A: How Affinity is spread:

-   Kill with ability - All Affinity on kill goes to the Warframe.

-   Kill with a weapon - Half to Warframe and half to weapon.

-   Completing a Challenge - Affinity split across all your gear.

-   Kills by allied Tenno - All the Affinity is split equally across all
    > your gear (Warframe/weapons). It does not affect their Affinity in
    > any way. Companions **do not** detract Affinity from this,
    > although they will get their own Affinity split half across the
    > weapon and the companion.

-   Kills by companion (Ability) - All Affinity goes to companion, the
    > owner gets no Affinity.

-   Kills by companion (Weapon) - Split evenly between companion weapon
    > and companion itself, the owner gets no Affinity.

Mastery
-------

Mastery is not Affinity, Affinity is XP for items. Mastery is a total of
what you've leveled.

Q: How do I get Mastery?

A: Mastery is gained through leveling anything. This means weapons,
Warframes, vehicles, companions, etc. A small amount of Mastery is also
awarded upon completing a Star Chart node for the first time.

Q: How much Mastery is earned for leveling up items?

A: Each maxed Warframe, companion, or Archwing gives 6k to your mastery,
or 200 per level. All weapons and K-Drives give 3k, or 100 per level.

Q: How much Mastery is needed to level up?

A: Each mastery rank takes 2500 to max, with every additional rank
adding 5000, additionally. So, Rank 1 takes 2500, Rank 2 takes 7500,
Rank 3 takes 12500, and so on.

Q: It says my Mastery requirement is maxed, what do I do now?

A: Once you max out all the Mastery for your current MR level, you can
rank up by completing an MR Test (see below).

Q: I've maxed out the Mastery requirement for my current MR, but I kept
leveling items after I capped. Did I lose that MR?

A: Mastery DOES carry over to the next rank, even if you haven\'t
completed the test yet. Once the test is finished, all carryover MR
earned from the previous rank will be instantly added to your current
rank.

Q: I forma'd this weapon, and it got reset to level 0. Will I get
Mastery from it again?

Forma'd equipment **DOES NOT** add to Mastery, despite what anyone says.
Only the first time leveling an item will count towards Mastery.

Q: I have two weapons that have the same name, do they both get Mastery?

Other variants of items give mastery, i.e. Braton gives 3k, Braton Prime
will give 3k, and Mk1 Braton will give 3k for a total of 9k. But once
you level up an item, i.e. Lato, leveling up another Lato will not give
Mastery.

Q: I sold a weapon before it was max level, did I lose any remaining
Mastery for it?

A: The game records how much you've leveled a weapon no matter if it is
in your inventory or not. If you leveled a weapon to level 10 and sold
it, the game records that you earned 1,000 Mastery from that weapon. If
you attain the weapon again, the game will not reward Mastery until the
weapon reaches level 11 and so on.

Q: Why should I care about Mastery?

A: Benefits of Mastery:

-   Gives your weapons and Warframes a flat starting bonus mod capacity
    > of your MR.

    -   A MR5 person has equipment that starts at 5/5 capacity.

    -   A MR23 person has equipment that starts at 23/23 capacity.

    -   This can be affected by a potato, doubling it.

    -   This does not mean you go over the limit, 30 or 60 will still be
        > the mod cap, not accounting for auras or stances.

<!-- -->

-   Changes your max limit of Void Traces.

-   Allows you access to certain Relays.

-   Allows access to certain equipment/quests.

-   Allows you to use certain levels of [[Riven
    > Mods]{.underline}](#riven-mods).

-   Increases your Daily Syndicate Standing capacity.

-   More trades a day (starting at MR2). Your Mastery rank +1 equals the
    > number of trades you can do.

-   Gives you "loadout" slots every other rank which allows easy
    > equipment switching.

-   Changes your Mastery Sigil to a different emblem every 3 ranks, and
    > a different color every rank.

### Mastery Rank Tests

Once you max out all the MR for your current level (can be seen in
profile), you will qualify for your next Mastery Rank Test. Each test is
different from the last, but are not different between players. Every
player must pass the same challenge. Keep in mind, MR tests are solo
only, and there is a 24 hour limit set on MR tests. So if you fail a
test, you cannot reattempt until 24 hours have passed. In addition, you
cannot gain more than one Mastery Rank per 24 hours. The player\'s next
Mastery Rank test will also be available for practice and, if eligible,
for rank up in [[Cephalon
Simaris]{.underline}](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Cephalon_Simaris)\'
Relay room. All previous levels of Mastery Tests may be practiced at any

[[hacking]{.underline}](#terminals-and-hacking) before attempting this
test.

**Mastery Rank 6 Test**

Target Tracking Test

This test requires players to track targets quickly and accurately.

The player starts the test standing on a brightly lit circular platform
in a dark room encircled with metallic spheres. The player\'s camera
will be turned toward the first target at the beginning of each round.
Upon shooting the first target, lines will connect unlit spheres in
succession before stopping at another target, this process will repeat
itself until the test has ended.

It is recommended to bring an accurate and/or high fire rate hitscan
weapon to this test.

**Mastery Rank 7 Test**

Timed Exterminate Test

in waves and must be dispatched before time ends.

It is recommended to bring a defensive or nuke Warframe to this test.

**Mastery Rank 8 Test**

Movement Test

This test requires players to jump across several platforms, with a
varying distance between each one. Shooting the red orbs that appear
spawns the next platform. Players have three tries to complete the test;

before attempting this test.

**Mastery Rank 9 Test**

Stealth Test

This test requires players to make use of cover and track enemy
movements in order to assassinate targets without detection using melee
weapons only.

Players start in a room equipped with only their melee weapon. They make
their way through three stages with increasing numbers of enemies and
increasingly complex patrol routes. Successful elimination of all
enemies in a stage will unlock the next. All enemies are level 1 and can
be insta-killed by a takedown.

Players are allowed three tries. Alerting an enemy counts as a try and
will reset the stage. Falling off a platform does not count as a try.
Also, there is no time limit.

It is recommended to bring a fast Warframe to this test, and to study
the enemy movements closely. Keep in mind there is no time limit.

**Mastery Rank 10 Test**

Disappearing Platform Test

This test requires players to eliminate targets at range, while
maneuvering on platforms in a 3x3 grid that will permanently disappear
after a few seconds of standing on them.

The player will spawn in on a normal platform and the test will begin
once you enter the grid area. You must kill all enemies spawning
periodically atop five elevated platforms which line the far end of the
grid. Once the player steps on a platform it will begin flashing
increasing in speed until it disappears 8 seconds later. All enemies are
level 1.

Players have three chances to complete the test. Falling from the
tileset counts as a try.

It is recommended to bring a high fire rate hitscan or high range beam
weapon to this test.

**Mastery Rank 11 Test**

Time Trial Test

This test requires players to make their way through an obstacle course
while shooting red orbs to increase the amount of time they have to
finish the course. Each orb adds 3.5 seconds of time.

It is recommended to use a fast Warframe for this test.

**Mastery Rank 12 Test**

Carousel Test

This test requires players to eliminate enemies while being aware of
their surroundings.

Players start on a platform facing a carousel-like structure with two
disks connected with a large pillar at their centers. Between the disks
are a set of lasers which separate the quadrants of the disks and slowly
rotate around the disks, essentially circling the \"carousel\".

The object of the test is to reach the carousel, eliminate 16 enemies
spawning on the outer disk, all while avoiding the moving lasers. All
enemies are level 1.

It is recommended to bring a high fire rate hitscan or high range beam
weapon to this test.

**Mastery Rank 13 Test**

Advanced Disappearing Platform Test

This test requires players to eliminate enemies while remaining
extremely mobile.

Players start facing a number of platforms surrounded by walls which can
be run across. Once the player touches a platform, it begins to flash
increasingly rapidly and will disappear after a few seconds. The
platforms are arranged with one in each corner, and three stacked
vertically in the center.

Players have three tries to eliminate all enemies on surrounding
platforms. Each fall counts as a try and returns all previously
exhausted platforms. All enemies are level 1.

It is recommended to bring a high fire rate hitscan or high range beam
weapon to this test. A nuke Warframe can also be used to make this test
trivial.

**Mastery Rank 14 Test**

Advanced Exterminate Test

This test requires players to eliminate three waves of enemies of levels
15-20.

The player starts on the first level of a tower with multiple cover
points and must eliminate targets until they are warped to the next
level. There are three waves with Grineer, Infested, and Corpus units
respectively.

It is recommended to bring a nuke Warframe to this test, and/or a high
damage beam or hitscan weapon.

**Mastery Rank 15 Test**

Interception Test

This test requires players to capture and hold points in an Interception
mission. All enemies are levels 15-18.

It is recommended to bring a fast or nuke Warframe to this test, and/or
a long range hitscan weapon.

**Mastery Rank 16 Test**

Defense Test

This test requires players to defend a Cryopod for 3 waves. Enemies are
Corpus, levels 24-27, and each wave will spawn 8/12/16 enemies
respectively.

It is recommended to bring a defensive or nuke Warframe to this test.

**Mastery Rank 17 Test**

Advanced Timed Exterminate Test

This test requires the player to kill 30 level 25-28 Infested targets
within a time limit. The player starts at 20 seconds. Meleeing the white
orbs that appear on the map grants an additional 7 seconds each.

It is recommended to bring a fast or nuke Warframe to this test, and/or
a high damage beam or hitscan weapon.

**Mastery Rank 18 Test**

Advanced Defense Test

This test requires the player to defend a Cryopod for 5 waves. Enemies
are Corpus, levels 25-28.

It is recommended to bring a defensive or nuke Warframe to this test.

**Mastery Rank 19 Test**

Stealth Rescue Test

This test requires the player to destroy six security orbs around a
large tileset, and then escort a rescue target to the extraction point,
all without being detected by the patrolling Grineer Lancers. All
Lancers are level 15.

It is recommended to bring a fast Warframe to this test.

**Mastery Rank 20 Test**

Archwing Time Trial Test

This test requires the player to fly between two platforms in Archwing
mode before the timer runs out. There is a series of rings between the
two platforms that grant additional time of 2 seconds when flown
through. The player starts out with 10 seconds.

It is recommended that you understand Archwing mechanics and flight
patterns before attempting this test.

**Mastery Rank 21 Test**

Timed Exterminate Test

This test requires the player to kill 35 level 25-28 Grineer enemies
before the timer runs out. The player must destroy white orbs with their
melee weapon to extend the timer, which spawn in random locations around
the map.

It is recommended to bring a fast or nuke Warframe to this test, and/or
a high damage beam or hitscan weapon.

**Mastery Rank 22 Test**

Arena Test

This test consists of three rounds requiring the player to kill 12/18/24
level 40 Executioners. The player is given 3 respawns before the mission
will fail. Executioners will spawn in pairs, a maximum of 6
simultaneously. The first round has a speed boost modifier, the second
round has a health drain modifier (drains 100 health periodically until
you have 3 health, killing enemies restores all health) and the third
round has a scaling enemies modifier. Falling out of the map uses one
respawn.

It is recommended to bring high survivability Warframes and high burst
damage weapons to this test.

**Mastery Rank 23 Test**

Mobile Point Capture Test

This test requires the player to capture 6 mobile control points before
the timer runs out by standing within a radius as they move along set
paths. Various types of level 40-45 Grineer enemies, including Manics,
will spawn throughout the map, attacking the player as they capture the
points. Capture progress will quickly decay while the player is outside
of the white radius. Each point will gradually turn green and then stop
moving upon reaching 100%.

It is recommended to use Rhino with an Iron Skin and speed build, or
Limbo with a speed build, so as to ignore the enemies and concentrate on
the points.

**Mastery Rank 24 Test** **(SPOILERS)**

Operator Test

This test requires the player to use their Operator to destroy an orb in
the center of a small arena, while being attacked by level 15 Infested
Brood Mothers and maggots. The player is given 3 respawns before the
mission will fail.

It is recommended to periodically kill the Brood Mothers, and Void Blast
any maggots on or around your Operator.

**Mastery Rank 25 Test**

Deployable Archwing Exterminate Test

This test requires the player to use an Archwing deployed by the
Archwing Launcher to traverse a multitude of floating platforms, killing
50 level 25-28 Grineer enemies, both grounded and airborne, before the
timer runs out. The player can extend the remaining time by melee
attacking the white orbs that spawn on these platforms.

It is recommended to use long distance or AOE weapons to kill enemies
from a distance or quickly, as the map is quite large.

**Mastery Rank 26 Test**

Advanced Mobile Point Capture Test

This test requires the player to capture 6 mobile control points within
5 minutes by standing within a radius as they move along set paths,
while under constant fire from level 40-45 Grineer. Unlike the MR23
test, the capture points in this test move up and down as well as
horizontally, and change speed much more rapidly. Capture progress will
quickly decay while the player is outside of the white radius. The point
will gradually turn green and then stop moving upon reaching 100%.

It is recommended to use Rhino with an Iron Skin and speed build, or
Limbo with a speed build, so as to ignore the enemies and concentrate on
the points.

**Mastery Rank 27 Test**

Point Collection Test

This test requires the player to collect 100 points from the map and
enemies, and turn them into a pad on one side of the map. The player has
5 minutes to accomplish this. Blue orbs will occasionally spawn on the
map and are worth 1 point each. Red orbs will drop from red enemies and
will spawn rarely, and are worth 3 points each. The more points that are
collected, the higher the enemies' levels will be. Using Vacuum or Fetch
will make collecting points easier.

It is recommended to use Rhino with Iron Skin, or a nuke frame, so as to
either ignore the blue enemies and prioritize the red enemies, or to
kill all enemies and only focus on collecting points.

Shields, Health, and Energy
---------------------------

### Shields

Shields protect your health and keep regenerating when you're not taking
damage. Shields will always start regenerating after 3 seconds of not
taking damage. This is your primary defense in most situations.

Q: Why is my shield bar suddenly purple?

A: Those are overshields, usually granted to you by Sentinel or Warframe
abilities and mods. They essentially raise your maximum shield capacity.

Q: Do my shields benefit from Armor?

A: No, only health benefits from armor.

Q: I'm losing health and my shields are still max, what gives?

A: It means your Warframe is being affected by a Status proc. If you
look at your Warframe and it looks like you're bleeding, that's a slash
proc. You get those by getting shot occasionally. The same will also
happen when you step in the green clouds of the infested, but that time
it's a toxin proc. Both go directly to health in damage, ignoring
shields.

### Health

Health is your hitpoints in the game and your secondary form of defense
just after your shields. Any attacks that break your shields will bleed
into your health pool. If your health goes down to 0 you are downed, and
need to be revived by allies or manually. Keep in mind you only have 4
manual revives per mission, after which you fail or are dead permanently
for the remainder of the mission. Team revives do not count as one of
the 4 revives. If all members of a squad are downed or are down
simultaneously, they all will need to manually revive. Armor applies to
health, and the higher your armor is the more damage reduction you can
get.

Q: Does my health regenerate?

A: No, but some Sentinel or Warframe abilities, equippable items, or
mods like Rejuvenation (Aura), Lifestrike, etc. will allow you to heal.

Q: Why is my health bar suddenly grey?

A: You are invulnerable while it's grey, but I'd suggest getting out of
danger if you can before the invulnerability runs out. Invulnerability
occurs with some Warframe abilities, after being revived, and in other
special cases.

Armor 
------

Armor is what it sounds like. This stat reduces the damage taken to
Health, but not shields. Both enemies and Players can possess armor.

Q: What does armor look like?

A: Enemies that have armor are given a yellow health bar. Armor cannot
be physically seen on your Warframe.

Q: Can I reduce or remove an enemy's armor?

A: You can strip away or negate an armor value by using certain
abilities or damage procs, thus turning an enemy's health bar red. The
most common is inflicting a corrosive proc, which reduces enemy armor by
25%.

Q: Why should I care about armor when I can just max out Health or
Shields?

A: Unlike Health or Shields, armor has a scaling return, which means it
passively gets better as missions get harder. It follows a basic formula
and scales better the later or longer missions last.

Q: What is the basic Damage Reduction Formula look like?

A: The damage reduction from armor is as follows:

Damage Reduction=Net Armor/(Net Armor +300)

A net armor value of 300 will reduce incoming damage by **300 ÷ 600 =
50%**, so only half of the weapon\'s damage is inflicted in

total. At **600**, you receive only **33%** (reduction is 600 ÷ 900 =
66.7%) of a weapon\'s outgoing damage. At **900** armor, inflicted
damage is only **25%** (reduction 900 ÷ 1200 = 75%), and so on.

Energy
------

Energy is essentially mana. It's the resource needed to use your
abilities in the game. Without it, you cannot use your abilities.

Q: Where do I get more energy in game?

A: Energy orbs drop from enemies, boxes, crates and in the lockers that
you open. Like health, some Sentinel or Warframe abilities, equippable
items, or mods like Energy Siphon (Aura), Energy Conversion, etc. will
allow you to gain more energy.

Q: Will I be able to make my own energy later?

A: Yes, via craftable energy pads, passive abilities, and some Warframe
abilities.

Powers and Abilities
--------------------

Powers are the 4 abilities that each frame gets (a few can have
additional hidden abilities). They define the frame and shape their
individual playstyles. Some will be more suited to support, while others
will be suited to taking heavy gunfire, or stunning entire areas. Either
way, learning about abilities is one the most important parts of the
game.

Warframe abilities are similar to that of other games, where one ability
is like 'an Ultimate', or Ult, and is more powerful than the rest. A
Warframe's Ult is almost always their 4th ability.

Q: Are all powers different?

A: For different Warframes yes, but for the different types of the same
Warframes they're the same. That all changes when Augment mods are
involved.

Q: Why does another Player's Ability/Power function differently from
mine?

A: The Warframe's build, and Augment mods. Some abilities have Augments
which change the way they work.

For a more in-depth analysis, see [[Warframe
Abilities]{.underline}](#warframe-abilities).

Critical Hits (Crits)
---------------------

![](media/image13.png){width="2.2322156605424324in"
height="2.244792213473316in"}

Q: What is a Critical Hit?

A: A Critical Hit is when an attack engages the Critical Multiplier of a
weapon, dealing an increased amount of damage based on the multiplier.
It appears as a different colored damage number.

Q: What happens when my crit goes above 100%?

A: Depending on how high your crit chance is, it will first go to level
1, yellow, then level 2, orange, then level 3, red. Yellow crits occur
anywhere from 1% to 199% crit chance. Orange crits occur between 100%
and 299% crit chance, and red crits occur after 200% crit chance. The
first level of crit will engage your crit multiplier, each new level of
crit will continually increase your crit multiplier. There are higher
levels of crit, however red is the final color of the crit.

Q: How does the crit formula work?

A: Crit Multiplier = Crit Level x (Base Crit Multiplier - 1) + 1

Crits are graded to the percentage of the crit chance. At \<100%, you
have the given chance to crit at level 1. At 100%+ you always crit at
level one and have a chance to get a level 2 crit.

So if you have 150% crit chance & 3x crit damage, you get 100% chance
for a lvl 1 crit, and 50% for a lvl 2. Plug in the numbers and let the
crit work out.

Level 2: 2 x (3-1) + 1 = 5x Crit multiplier

Level 1: 1 x (3-1) + 1 = 3x Crit Multiplier

Polarities
----------

![](media/image11.png){width="2.0301017060367452in"
height="1.5052088801399826in"}

Polarities are found on mods and the Arsenal upgrade menu. When a mod is
applied to a mod slot without a polarity, the drain on the card will
cost exactly that. When a mod and a mod slot have the same polarity, the
mod's drain is halved. When a mod is applied to a slot with a different
polarity, the drain is increased by 25% (there are some exceptions to
this system).

There are 3 main polarities. They are known as the:

V (V polarity) aka Madurai

\- (Dash polarity) aka Naramon

D (d polarity) aka Vazarin

There are 4 alternate polarities. They are known as the:

= (Scratch polarity) aka Zenurik

r (r polarity) aka Unairu

y (Y polarity) aka Penjaga

U (U polarity) aka Umbra

Matching the polarity will reduce drain by 50% rounded up.

ex. 11V → V Polarity = 5.5 = 6 Mod drain

Not matching the polarity will increase drain by 25%, rounded up.

ex. 10d → - Polarity = 12.5 = 13 Mod drain

Some mod slots have an opposite, positive effect. These occur on
Warframe Aura slots and Melee Stance slots.

When applying an Aura/Stance mod to a Warframe/melee weapon, the drain
of the mod is ADDED to the Warframe/melee weapon's total mod drain. The
additional drain is doubled when used with a matching polarity, while
25% added drain is lost when using the wrong polarity.

Crafting and the Foundry
------------------------

Crafting blueprints is the backbone of *Warframe*. All crafting and
resource management is done in the Foundry.

Q: How long do things take to build?

A: Blueprint crafting time ranges anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 days.
Building any Warframe takes 3 days. Building any weapon takes either 12
or 24 hours. Keys and other rare gear items and resources typically take
8-12 hours to build. Smaller gear items, consumables, and general
resource blueprints usually take one minute to one hour to complete.

Q: Do things craft only when I'm in the game?

A: No, the crafting timers are real world, and are tracked by the game
engine. This means that if you start a blueprint that takes 24 hours at
12:00 PM on a Tuesday, then it will finish crafting at 12:00 PM on
Wednesday.

Q: Should I rush "x"?

A: Generally no, but that's personal preference. If you have Platinum to
spare, and really want the item, go ahead. But generally, the Platinum
used to rush something can be used to buy other more helpful or
important things.

Q: Is there any way to queue crafting?

A: No. You can craft as many things as you'd like at one time, but you
cannot craft more than one of the same item at a time. For example, if
you're building Rhino, then you can also build Nova, but you cannot
build another Rhino.

Q: I farmed Argon Crystals and they're suddenly missing. What happened?

A: Argon Crystals naturally decay. Your total amount halves every day
until you have none left. So if you have 12 on the first day, on the
second you'll have 6, then 3 then 2 then 1 then none. This is the only
resource that decays.

Q: If I cancel something that's crafting, will I get everything back?

A: Yes, you will get all resources and credits back, but if you go and
try to build it again, it will once again take the full amount of time.

The Codex
---------

The Codex is your journal to *Warframe.* It includes your Quest List,
along with all your discovered weapons, Warframes, companions, mods, and
relics. It also includes short tutorials on in-game mechanics and
missions.

By using a Codex Scanner, or other scanning tools such as the Helios
sentinel, you can scan items and enemies in missions to have them added
to your codex. Each item takes a set amount of scans before their
information is viewable, from 1-24. Scanning enemies will reveal lore,
their weaknesses, attacks, locations, and potential drops.

Scanning Cephalon Fragments will unlock lore which is viewable in the
Codex.

Nightwave - Series 1
--------------------

Nightwave is the new alert system introduced with update 24.3.0. It
features a new NPC, Nora Night, who is a radio show host that can be
accessed using your Orbiter's scanner.

Nightwave is introduced in Series. The current Nightwave series is also
the first - The Wolf of Saturn Six. Nora Night is tracking a number of
high security inmates who have escaped a Grineer prison, and who are
being led by the most savage of them all, The Wolf. Each Series lasts
approximately 10-11 weeks, with each Series having a different story and
rewards.

For each Series, you must complete Daily and Weekly challenges, known as
Acts. These Acts are given by Nora Night to earn Nightwave standing.
Every 10,000 standing gives a different reward. Daily challenges give
1,000 standing each, while Weekly challenges give 3,000 standing. Elite
Weekly challenges are more difficult missions that award 5,000 standing
each. Daily missions reset at 00:00 GMT every day, while weekly missions
reset at 00:00 GMT on Sundays. Once the missions reset and are removed
from the challenge board, their standing cannot be gained anymore.

Like Riven challenges, some Nightwave challenges can be obtained across
several missions, with mission success not being required, unless the
challenge says it must be done in one instance.

With Series 1 comes The Wolf and his fellow inmates. The Wolf can appear
in any mission as a Field Boss, similar to The Stalker. There are no
requirements to get him to spawn, but appearances are extremely rare. He
has the chance to drop mods and Wolf Sledge parts. Inmates can also
appear in any mission in squads of 3. Defeating and capturing them
awards 50 Nightwave standing per inmate. Inmates do not have any drops.

Daily Reward
------------

The Daily Reward is a tribute system in Warframe, awarding players every
24 hours when they log in. The Daily Reward resets at 00:00 GMT.

Q: If I skip a day, will the daily reward reset?

A: Nope, it's cumulative. This means that if you play every other day
for 10 days, you'll get 5 Daily Rewards.

Q: What do I get out of it?

A: Usually a small amount of a random resource. Before 50 days, a
weapon/Warframe blueprint will occasionally be awarded. Rarely you can
receive a short random booster, with length determined by the amount of
days played. Even more rarely you can receive a one-use Platinum
discount coupon, lasting 48 hours, and ranging from 20%-75% off Market
priced Platinum. Every 50 days there's a milestone that will reward you
with a cache (usually a potato + sigil), a special weapon, or a unique
Primed mod. These caches, weapons or mods do not change from person to
person and cannot be traded, so those items cannot be account farmed.

Pickups
-------

Throughout the game, enemies and containers will drop items that can be
picked up by walking over them. These range from resources, to ammo, to
health and energy.

**Ammo Pickups**

-   Grey box with orange line - Pistol Ammo

-   Grey box with white line - Shotgun Ammo

-   Grey box with blue line - Rifle Ammo

    > specialized missions.

-   Small glowing blue or orange star - Ayatan Star

Terminals and Hacking
---------------------

Throughout *Warframe*, you will need to utilize your reflexes and
problem-solving abilities to hack through terminals. Hacking is required
to open locked doors, deactivate alarms, release a hostage, retrieve
items from consoles, retrieve data from vaults, and more. When hacking,
there is a set time limit. If the hack is not completed successfully,
you will be kicked out of the hack menu and will have to try again from
the start.

There are 2 types of console problems - Grineer and Corpus.

![](media/image3.jpg){width="3.816221566054243in"
height="2.151042213473316in"}

Grineer consoles appear as a circle with 3-8 slots stretching from the
center to the outside. A cursor rotates the outside of the circle at a
constant rate. You must press the \[SPACE BAR\] when the cursor is over
one of the slots to activate it. The slot will then light up yellow and
move into the center slightly. Once all slots have been activated, the
terminal is successfully hacked. Activating a slot again after it has
already been activated will move it back out to the edge, and you will
have to hit it again.

On advanced Grineer Consoles, the cursor will be faster and will change
direction after each successful slot activation.

![](media/image7.jpg){width="3.6187423447069116in"
height="3.4531255468066493in"}

Corpus consoles appear as a series of 2-7 hexagonal pieces, each with a
series of lines originating from the center. You must match the lines to
each other by rotating the hexagons, so that all the lines are
connected. \[LEFT MOUSE CLICK\] will rotate the hexagons clockwise,
while \[RIGHT MOUSE CLICK\] will rotate them counter-clockwise. Once all
lines are connected, the hack is successful.

Ciphers are buildable gear items that, when equipped in your gear wheel,
can be used when activating a console to instantly complete the hack.
Ciphers cannot be used in Sortie Missions and some event missions.
Ciphers can be instantly used by pressing \[Y\] while in a hack screen.

Helminth Cyst
-------------

The Helminth Cyst is a growth that can appear on any Warframe. It
appears as a small pink boil, and takes 7 real days to mature. You can
tell when it is mature when a pink tendril emerges from the center of
the growth. Once mature, the Cyst can be removed in your Infested room
by the Helminth.

![](media/image4.png){width="2.627680446194226in"
height="1.7552088801399826in"}

The Cyst is gained from coming into contact (playing a game) with
another Warframe who has the Cyst. Once removed, however, that Warframe
can never gain the Cyst again.

Draining the Cyst while breeding a Kubrow will turn it into a Helminth
Charger, a unique strain.

It is jokingly referred to as Cancer or AIDS in-game, as it is a
spreadable, contractible ailment.

Having the Cyst does not affect anything in your loadout, as it is just
cosmetic. Many consider removing it necessary, as it does not match with
many color schemes or skins.

Advanced Mechanics
==================

Stealth
-------

As Space Ninjas, many Warframes are capable of advanced stealth
capabilities. While it is fun to run and gun your way through the Star
Chart, it is sometimes necessary to slow down and sneak your way through
enemy lines.

Sight and sound are what determines your stealth capability. The enemies
have 3 levels of alertness - unalerted, on-guard, and alerted. When
enemies see you, see a comrade killed by you, or hear your weapon, they
will become on-guard. If no additional stimulus is given for a short
time, they will return to unalerted. But if they continue to see or hear
things, they will become alerted and attempt to either search you out,
or activate the alarms. Once alarms are on, all enemies will become
alerted, no matter what they have seen or heard. This can be disabled by
hacking the alarms.

You can avoid alerting enemies in two ways - staying out of sight, or
not making sound. Warframes such as Loki and Ash have the ability to
turn invisible, which will keep you out of sight of enemies. Killing
enemies and firing weapons will still make their comrades on-guard. Many
weapons come innately silenced, and all melee weapons are considered
silent. But all weapons in the game can be silenced using mods. However,
projectile and explosive weapons, even if silenced, can still alert
enemies once their payload is delivered or explodes. In addition,
[[Syndicate]{.underline}](#syndicates) Procs from Syndicate weapons
cannot be silenced, and will alert enemies if used.

Alarms can also be triggered by tripping a sensor, camera, or trap.
These can be seen from their sweeping detector beams, as bumps in the
floor, or energy walls. Invisible Warframes will not trip cameras, but
will trip energy walls and traps.

Disabled and unconscious enemies cannot detect anything to make them
alerted. Sleep Warframes such as Equinox and Ivara can put enemies to
sleep, and walk right past them.

Enemy line of sight and sound are influenced by direction and distance.
If you kill an enemy when their comrade's back is turned, they won't
become suspicious. If you shoot an enemy with an unsilenced weapon a
distance away from other enemies, they also will not become suspicious.

Running, jumping, using abilities, and using gear items will not alert
enemies.

Focus
-----

**(SPOILERS)**

Q: How do I unlock the Focus trees?

A: After the completion of "The Second Dream" questline.

Q: Which is the best school?

A: That's mostly opinion based. However, as a quick rundown, here are
the schools and their main benefit.

-   Naramon - Combos and Speed

-   Zenurik - Energy

-   Madurai - Damage

-   Unairu - Armor and 'Return Damage'

-   Vazarin - Instant Revives & Healing

It's best to choose the school you're probably going to use the most.

Q: It says Quills need to be unlocked?

A: After the completion of the Plains of Eidolon questline Saya's Vigil,
you speak to the Quills' leader (North of Konzu) in Cetus. After that
you will be able to upgrade your focus tree(s).

Q: How do lenses work? Why am I not getting focus?

A: Lenses must be equipped to a Warframe or weapon, then used in a
mission to gain focus. Lenses change a small percentage of affinity past
lvl 30 to focus. So if you've forma'd something, or it's not level 30,
it gains no focus.

Q: Where do I get lenses?

A: You can buy Greater Lens blueprints from the market for credits, or
already built ones for plat. Eidolon Lens blueprints and regular lenses
are rewards from PoE's bounties, while Fortuna bounties only give
regular lenses. Lenses can also be traded.

Q: I have a Greater Lens, but I can't trade it and doesn't show in the
trade menu. What gives?

A: Greater lenses cannot be traded in any way. They can only be obtained
in the market or via bounties.

Q: Which school is best for x frame?

Q: What lens should I equip for x frame?

A: It doesn't really matter. The lenses are only there to gain focus,
the effects are universal as long as you equip it. Some schools will
benefit some Warframes, but no school hinders any Warframes.

Q: My passives aren't working!

A: You need to click on the passive tile in your focus menu to activate
it, and for the passive to work in a mission.

Q: What is my Focus Pool?

A: The Focus Pool is your focus abilities capacity. You can increase
your capacity by feeding focus into your pool. Not having enough
capacity means you can't activate more abilities.

Q: Can I have more than one school or school's abilities active at the
same time?

A: No, only one school's passives and abilities may be active at the
same time. Your current active school is labeled as Primary and is at
the bottom of the school wheel. However, each school has two nodes
called Waybounds, that if unbound using a Brilliant Eidolon Shard, may
be used with other schools. This means you can have up to 8 extra
passives/abilities active with your primary school.

Q: Will I lose my potato/forma/lens if I forma/potato/lens it?

A: Anything that you put on, will stay on the Warframe/weapon. If it's
potatoed before, it stays potatoed. The only one that changes, is if you
put a lens onto a piece of equipment that already has a lens. You then
lose the old lens, as it gets replaced.

Q: What are Amps? What do they do?

A: See [[Amps]{.underline}](#_6ofxz7ebtyto)**.**

Q: How do I unbound a passive?

A: Firstly check if the node has 'waybound' on it. If it does, you can
unbind it by maxing it out, then using 1M focus and a Brilliant Shard to
unlock it for any other school. Keep in mind, you still need to activate
it and you need the pool to be able to activate it.

Arcanes
-------

**(SPOILERS)**

![](media/image15.png){width="2.4945713035870516in"
height="1.734375546806649in"}

Arcanes are fusible upgrade items, similar to mods. They all provide an
additional effect, buff, or passive when equipped. The Arcane menu can
be accessed from the Foundry. Arcanes come in 3 rarities, common,
uncommon, and rare. All Arcanes can be fused with copies of themselves
to increase their effects. Arcanes come in 4 levels, with each level
requiring more copies to upgrade. Level 1 Arcanes need only one copy to
use. Level 2 Arcanes need the original, plus 2 copies. Level 3 Arcanes
need the original Level 2 Arcane, plus 3 copies. Level 4 Arcanes need
the original Level 3 Arcane, plus 4 copies, for a total of 10 copies.

An Arcane can only be equipped to a specific piece of equipment. There
are Arcanes available for Warframes, the Operator,
[[Amps]{.underline}](#amps-spoilers), [[Zaws]{.underline}](#zaws), and
[[Kit Guns]{.underline}](#kit-guns).

Warframe Arcanes drop from
[[Eidolons]{.underline}](#eidolon-hunting-spoilers). Operator and Amp
Arcanes can be bought from Quill Onkko or Little Duck for Standing. Zaw
Arcanes can only be acquired from [[Plague
Star]{.underline}](#plague-star). Kit Gun Arcanes can be bought from
Rude Zuud for Standing.

Weapons can only hold one Arcane at a time, regardless of Arcane level.
Warframes and the Operator can hold two Arcanes at max. You can equip
two of the same Arcane to a Warframe or Operator for twice its effect.

All Arcanes can be traded between players.

Cephalon Simaris
----------------

Cephalon Simaris is one of the ancient Cephalon AIs created by the
Orokin. He is obsessed with how living things function and fight. He can
be found in his Sanctuary in any Relay.

Simaris asks the Tenno to help him with Synthesis, or the scanning and
capture of beings from the Origin System, in order to study them.
Simaris will have a daily Synthesis target every 24 hours. Scanning a
set number of these targets will award the player with Standing and a
reward from Simaris' drop table, usually Endo.

Scanning targets requires a Synthesis Scanner, a modified version of the
Codex Scanner. It can be bought from Simaris' offerings for credits.
Simaris also offers Synthesis Traps, which will trap and suspend a
Synthesis target for a short period of time.

When starting a mission with a target present, Simaris will inform you
when you enter the mission. By looking through a Synthesis Scanner, you
can see a trail of blue and white floating prints that will lead to the
target. Each target has 4 scannable points on its body. Each one must be
scanned once to fully capture the target.

Scanning anything other than the target will reward a small amount of
Standing, even if the item being scanned has already been completed in
the Codex.

Simaris' offerings include unique and powerful mods, weapons, mod
transmute cores, Scanner modifications, and Captura Scenes. It also
includes the Simulacrum access key.

### The Simulacrum

Cephalon Simaris' Simulacrum is a simulator the Tenno can use to test
their weapons and abilities in. You must obtain the Simulacrum access
key from Simaris' offerings for 50,000 Standing in order to access it.

Within, you will find a small datascape tileset, with an Arsenal,
spawning console, and infinite health, energy, and ammo pickups on a
raised platform. The spawning console has the ability to spawn up to 20
enemies at once. The enemies available are ones that have been fully
scanned into the Codex. You can then modify if the enemies can move or
not, their level, and give yourself invincibility from their attacks.

Captura
-------

Captura is a somewhat hidden feature for taking screenshots. It can be
found in any Warframe's appearance menu, in the lower right. Captura
allows you to enter a specific tile or location, and gives extra options
for camera, lighting, filters, and angles.

Captura Scenes can be bought from Syndicates, NPCs, as rewards from
missions, or traded between players. You cannot use Captura without
having at least one scene.

When entering Captura, you can open the Menu with \[G\]. This will pause
the scene and everything in it, and gives you a free camera separate
from your Warframe view. From there you can edit lighting, filters, and
field of view for the optimum angle. From there you can screenshot
through *Warframe* or a third-party source.

A full squad can join one Captura Scene, for multi-Warframe screenshots.
Only the host can access the Menu though.

Etiquette
=========

1.  Don't go into a mission without knowing what your frame can do, and
    > what it's supposed to do.

2.  Don't ignore the chat. Lots of bad things can happen when the chat
    > is ignored.

3.  Stick with your team, affinity is shared. Don't hallway-hero (sit in
    > one hallway and kill things without your team).

4.  Don't use Life Support in survival missions if it's over 70%, they
    > all restore 30%. Preferably restore it at 40, so if 2 players try
    > to restore at the same time, none gets wasted.

5.  Wait for people at elevators/checkpoints, last in gets to send it
    > off.

6.  If you see a cephalon fragment/rare drop, mark it with your waypoint
    > \[G\]. Rare drops have a large gold or green line/vertical beam of
    > light that extends upward from them. Even if you don't see it, you
    > can mark it's general area.

7.  If you see flickering, try to regroup with allies. This usually
    > marks an Assassin or hit-squad, hard to kill enemies that will
    > hunt you down.

8.  Unless you're playing with friends, or they say so, starting the
    > timer on a mission in the lobby is a jackass move.

9.  During Excavation missions, carry power cells with you when going to
    > the next Excavator.

10. If you can't do a Spy, say so, it's better to learn than to
    > constantly mess it up every time.

11. Pubs are pubs, don't expect them to play the way you want, ask if
    > they can do something different if it's hindering the mission.

12. If you're getting ready to close the game but want to play one or
    > two more missions, don't play endless missions. Most people want a
    > full rotation, i.e. 20 waves / 20 mins / 4 Excavators.

13. When doing things on the Plains or Orb Vallis, if you're the host
    > please don't exit randomly. You'll mess up other people's drops.

Quick Start Guide
=================

Few things a newbie should do/understand:

1.  Finish [[Vor's Prize]{.underline}](#vors-prize), which unlocks all
    > the basic segments & components you need.

2.  Head to Venus Junction to receive the Taxon Sentinel and Vacuum,
    > helps immensely in getting your loot.

3.  Run Bosses (Mission Credits + Frame BP) and Dark Sectors for
    > credits.

4.  After you max (lvl 30) your weapons, try to attain their upgrades,
    > Braton does better than the mk1, so does the Strun, etc etc.

5.  Try to rush to Maroo's Bazaar on Mars, for the weekly ayatan quest.
    > This is a massive injection of Endo early in the game.

6.  Don't burn yourself out trying to climb MR too fast. Take your time
    > and enjoy the game.

I have to say that this one is done completely solo, as in, with no one
to help me. If you do get someone to help you great! However, to find
and progress through the game I find this to be the most efficient
route.

Right now this should really get you more than started when it comes to
playing *Warframe*. If you've made it this far it's already taken you
through about half the game, and puts you where it's going to start
getting a bit more exciting.

Missions
========

Nearly everything in *Warframe* is accomplished by completing missions.
Mission nodes are available on the Star Chart, and more missions become
available as you complete them. There are 5 types of missions;
Non-endless, Endless, Special, Bounties, and Archwing.

Non-Endless Mission Types

applied to them, along with unique rewards.

-   Alert - A limited time mission with additional loot table rewards
    > given upon completion.

    > and double the kuva reward.

-   (Elite) Sanctuary Onslaught - Eliminate enemies to maintain kill
    > efficiency. Zone/enemies change every 2 minutes. ESO starts at
    > level 60, while SO starts at level 20. Has a unique reward pool
    > that includes relics, Vandal weapon parts, and Khora parts (SO
    > only).

    > 300% strength/damage boost respectively. Revives are disabled, and
    > rotations are twice as long. Has a unique reward pool for every
    > instance completed.

Mission Rotation Rewards
------------------------

Some missions have specific reward tables after accomplishing/finding
certain objectives. They are referred to using the letters A, B, and C.
Missions like Spy and Sabotage give their rewards consecutively, meaning
all 3 objectives must be found/completed to get to reward table C.
Endless missions give their rewards on a rotation, meaning you must stay
the full cycle to get to reward table C.

-   Spy Missions: Each successfully hacked terminal will give a reward
    > from table A, B, and C respectively.

-   Sabotage Caches: Each cache found and opened will give a reward from
    > table A, B, and C respectively.

-   Defense: Rotating cycle of A, A, B, C over 20 waves, one reward from
    > the respective table every 5 waves.

-   Survival: Rotating cycle of A, A, B, C over 20 minutes, one reward
    > from the respective table every 5 minutes.

-   Excavation: Rotating cycle of A, A, B, C over 4 excavators, one
    > reward from the respective table for every completed excavator.

-   Interception/Infested Salvage: Rotating cycle of A, A, B, C over 4
    > 100% captures, one reward from the respective table for every

Junctions
---------

Junctions are special missions that have prerequisites in order to

The Conclave
------------

The Conclave is a neutral Faction led by Teshin. It is made up of the
only PvP game modes of *Warframe*, along with unique Faction rewards.

**Conclave Game Modes**

-   Annihilation - Free for all, every player killed drops a red Oro
    > pickup. First player to collect 25 Oros, or the player with the
    > most after 10 minutes wins.

-   Team Annihilation - 4 v 4 Deathmatch, every player killed drops a
    > red Oro pickup. First team to collect 50 Oros, or the team with
    > the most after 10 minutes wins.

-   Cephalon Capture - 4 v 4 Capture the Flag. A team must steal the
    > enemy Cephalon from the enemy base and bring it to their base to
    > score. First team to reach the score limit wins.

-   Lunaro - 4 v 4 sport game, similar to Football (American Soccer). No
    > weapons are used. A player must take control of the Lunaro sphere
    > and get it into the enemy goal to score. First team to reach the
    > score limit wins.

Conclave game modes allow for any Warframes and weapons to be used, but
PvE mods cannot be used. There are special Conclave PvP mods that can be
acquired through the Faction or regular gameplay that can be equipped in
your Conclave arsenal.

Weapons and Warframe abilities are modified in the Conclave for
balancing reasons. Some weapons and abilities may perform differently
from how you are used to them in regular missions, and some abilities
may be disabled entirely. Warframes also have modified health, shield,
and armor values in the Conclave.

It should be noted that due to the uniqueness and lack of content in the
Conclave, it is regularly under-populated and games take much longer to
find than in the Star Chart.

Equipment
=========

**Warframes**
-------------

Warframes function as the classes of *Warframe*. Each one comes equipped
with unique passives and abilities, with different strengths and
weaknesses.

Q: If I potato/use a Orokin Reactor on a Warframe, is it permanent?

A: Yes.

Q: Can I use multiple potatoes/reactors on my Warframe?

A: No.

Q: Do I have to wait until lvl 30 to potato my Warframe?

A: No, once used it will always double your mod capacity. So if you
potato it at lvl 3 it gains +3, but when you level it to 30, it will
give +30.

Q: Do I have to potato my frame after every forma?

A: No, potatoes are permanent. Putting a forma on an item will reset its
level to 0 but it will let you add a polarity slot of your choice to it.

Q: Does a Warframe keep any potatoes or forma installed if I sell it?

A: No, selling a Warframe deletes that instance of it. Building a
Warframe of the same type would just be creating a new instance, and
upgrades will have to be done again.

Q: What's this locked mod slot beside the aura?

A: That's an exilus slot, unlocked by an exilus adaptor. You can only
put exilus mods into it. (See [[modding]{.underline}](#mods) for exilus
mods)

Q: I found a Warframe that I like, where do I find the blueprints/parts
for it?

A: Here is a list of places to get them from, sorted by name. They are
dropped by bosses on an Assassinate node, via Quests, from missions,
from specific enemies, or in your Clan Dojo.

Q: I've been killing Eximii / Eximus / Eximuses, where's my Oberon
parts?

A: It's not a really high chance. Just play through the game, you'll get
the parts eventually.

Q: What are Prime Warframes?

A: Lore wise, they're prototypes (the original frames). Gameplay wise,
they give minor buffs to shields / armor / health / energy, have
alternate mod polarities, and come with a unique skin. Otherwise they're
basically the same as the normal ones.

Q: How do I get Prime Warframes?

A: Farm for the relics where the parts are sealed in, and unlock the
relic to get the part. Prime Warframes have the same parts as regular;
blueprint, chassis, neuroptics, and systems. Prime Warframe blueprints
can also be traded between players, or bought with real currency in
Prime Access or Prime Unvaulting packs. Occasionally, [[Twitch
Prime]{.underline}](#twitch-prime) will have a Prime Warframe available
to subscribers.

### Frame Etiquette

When playing with certain frames, try to work with them, often you'll do
much better and the mission will be much easier.

-   Banshee

    -   Shoot the massive glowing spots. Deals quite a lot of damage.

-   Chroma

    -   Let Chroma run out first, much better if they shoot him rather
        > than you. Also, stand near him to gain buffs.

-   Equinox

    -   If day or night, try to stay in her aura (swirly thing around
        > her). It either gives power strength buffs, heals, or reduces
        > enemy damage.

-   Frost

    -   Stay in the globe if you don't want to get shot at.

    -   Can cast globe multiple times to add armor to it.

    -   For Frosts, clean up your globes (by pressing 1 on it while
        > you're on the outside) and don't globe interception points.

-   Gara

    -   Colour your energy less bright. Super bright colours are
        > annoying when it comes to mass vitrify.

    -   If possible, help keep allies alive. Your 2 can be cast on them
        > so they also receive damage reduction.

-   Harrow

    -   If it's a team based Harrow, with a large circle around him, let
        > him get kills. Gives everyone including him energy. If you
        > kill them, neither you nor the Harrow will get the energy

-   Hydroid

    -   Shoot into the puddle. Also try to help him out by killing
        > Nullifiers.

    -   Puddles can heal you if the Hydroid has the augment.

-   Inaros

    -   If you're the Inaros, stop leeching health of allies while
        > downed.

    -   Try not to spam Sandstorm, it makes targets really difficult to
        > hit and messes up melee combos.

-   Ivara

    -   Staying in the bubble gives you invisibility.

-   Limbo

    -   For Limbos, don't always stasis everything unnecessarily. It's
        > generally not needed.

    -   Rolling removes the rift.

-   Nekros

    -   When playing with a Nekros, use slash based weaponry. It breaks
        > the bodies into additional pieces and that means more loot.

-   Nezha

    -   Staying in the fire from firewalker removes debuffs.

-   Nidus

    -   In longer missions, try not to mess with a Nidus and his stacks,
        > he needs it for the later part of the game. This means not
        > blowing up the things in his larva unless he asks you to.

    -   Stand on the grass if health is needed.

-   Nyx

    -   Don't shoot at a Nyx's absorb unless she's trying to leech or
        > AFK.

    -   For Nyxes, when playing a defense or intercept, you can remove
        > mind control by pressing 1. Stops the wait for the last enemy
        > to die

-   Oberon

    -   Stand near him during the start, and stand on the grass to get
        > Iron Renewal

-   Octavia

    -   Crouch to the beat to get invisibility, jump to get movespeed,
        > shoot to get multishot, and melee to get extra damage.

-   Saryn

    -   Shoot spores on enemies.

-   Titania

    -   Don't knock away her lantern (glowy enemy that looks like it has
        > a vortex on it).

-   Trinity

    -   For Trinities, keep your player list up by pressing \[Z\] and
        > watch your allies' health.

    -   For Trinities, even if you're an EV Trin or a Blessing, you can
        > still cast the rest of your skills.

    -   Stay near and protect Trinity to gain health and energy.

-   Volt

    -   Electric shield works 2 ways.

    -   Backflipping (aim + back + roll) removes speed.

Q: What does it mean for something to be "vaulted"?

A: It means the relics for the vaulted item can no longer be obtained in
the regular game. However, relics and parts already owned do not go
away, and Primed items can still be traded.

Q: If a frame gets vaulted, do I get to keep the frame?

A: Yes, of course!

Q: You said nothing about Excalibur Prime, is he still farmable?

A: No, he's not in the Prime Vault and he's not farmable. He was part of
the Founder's package back when the game was first released. He is
currently unobtainable by any means. He will most likely never be
obtainable ever again.

Q: How does vaulting work?

A: All relics that will be vaulted will be removed from drop tables.
Anything else you have, you will keep. This includes the relics
themselves, the items, parts and crafted items.

Q: Will the vault be reopened?

A: Yes, every \~3 months DE unvaults previously vaulted Warframes and
items, and vaults current ones. This is called Prime Unvaulting.

### Fashion Frame and Cosmetics (SPOILERS)

Fashion Frame is the act of combining different color, armor, and skin
combinations on a Warframe to make it look cool and unique, or to fit a
theme. The term also applies to weapons, Companions and Operators. This
is considered an endgame, optional activity, as almost all of the
cosmetics and colors necessary for Fashion Frame cost Plat or real
currency.

There are three types of cosmetic items; Deluxe, Tennogen, and Prime
Access.

-   Deluxe items are created by DE and always cost Plat. They include
    > Warframe skins, weapon skins, armor packs, Companion armor,
    > Operator armor, Operator accessories, Syandanas, and Sugatras.

-   Tennogen items are created by digital artists with creative
    > permissions from DE. Tennogen items always cost a predetermined
    > amount of real currency, 30% of which goes to the artist/creator
    > of the item. Tennogen items include Warframe skins, weapons skins,
    > Operator accessories, and Syandanas.

-   Prime Access items are always included in the Accessories Pack of a
    > [[Prime Access]{.underline}](#prime-access), and are available
    > only as long as the Prime Access is. They are not obtainable in
    > any other way. The Accessories Pack costs real currency, and can
    > either be bought on its own or as part of the Tier 3 Prime Access
    > pack. Prime Access items can include helmets for the newly Primed
    > Warframe, Prime armor sets, Primed Operator armor, Primed Operator
    > accessories, Prime Syandanas, and Prime Sugatras.

#### Regalia

There are 3 types of Regalia; Emblems, Sigils, and glyphs.

Emblems are equipped in the Regalia section of the Warframe appearance
menu, and include the Clan and Event emblems, along with any Event
emblems earned. They appear on your Warframe's left and right shoulders.
Only the Clan and Alliance emblems can be purchased.

Sigils are equipped in the Regalia section of the Warframe appearance
menu, and include the Assassin and Syndicate sigils. They appear on your
Warframe's chest and back. Sigils cannot be purchased, but are
occasionally available in Prime Access.

Glyphs are equipped in the Profile section of the \[ESC\] menu. They
appear next to your name and gear in the squad list. Glyphs can be
earned, bought with platinum, redeemed with access codes, or awarded by
other players/streamers. Your equipped glyph is also what appears when
using the Glyph gear item.

Weapons
-------

Q: Should I potato/use an orokin catalyst on x?

A: A general rule of thumb is if you feel that it's good, potato it.
However, it's a pretty good idea NOT to potato/upgrade the mk 1 weapons
and to experiment before you potato a weapon.

Q: If I potato / use a catalyst on a weapon is it permanent?

A: Yes.

Q: Can I use multiple potatoes / catalysts on my weapon?

A: No.

Q: Do I have to wait until lvl 30 to potato / catalyst my weapon?

A: No, once used it will always double your mod capacity. So if you
potato it at lvl 3 it gains +3, and if you level it to 30, it will give
+30.

Q: How do I use forma? I heard you can upgrade weapons with it.

A: On a lvl 30 or maxed piece of equipment, go to upgrade, on the bottom
right side, there should be an action button. Once you click on it, you
have a choice to forma your weapon to give it another polarity.

Q: What are Prime weapons?

A: Lore wise, they're prototypes (the original weapons). Gameplay wise,
they give minor buffs to its stats. Otherwise they're basically the same
as the normal ones with a different aesthetic.

Q: How do I get Prime weapons?

A: Farm for the relics where the parts are sealed in, and unlock the
relic to get the part. Prime weapons have a multitude of parts needed to
build, depending on the weapon and type. Prime weapon blueprints can
also be traded between players, or bought with real currency in Prime
Access or Prime Unvaulting packs. Occasionally, [[Twitch
Prime]{.underline}](#twitch-prime) will have a Prime weapon available to
subscribers.

Q: What does it mean for something to be "vaulted"?

A: It means the relics for the vaulted item can no longer be obtained in
the regular game. However, relics and parts already owned do not go
away, and Primed items can still be traded.

Q: What weapons should I get first?

A: See the suggested List below.

### The Suggested Beginner Weapon List

These weapons are handpicked for 3 distinct categories. They are easy to
obtain, easy to mod and easy to use. When I say this, it means that
stuff like the Prisma Grakata don't belong, since they aren't always
available. Neither are weapons with immensely expensive mod requirements
(ie Maiming Strike \> 2 Primed mods). Preference should be paid to
weapons that are available early (Pre MR7).

***The Following is a Suggested list of beginner weapons and do not
represent the best weapons in the game.***

#### Primaries

-   **DMR - Latron *MR 0 &* Veldt *MR 8***

> The Latron is a good all around starter weapon, it boasts high
> accuracy and fire rate but has a high recoil. Veldt on the other hand
> is more akin to a sniper without being one, high dmg and fire rate
> make it a no brainer for the Tenno marksman.

-   **Rifle - Baza *MR7 &* Soma *MR 6***

> The Baza is a low damage, high fire rate smg that has damage fall off
> like a shotgun but has a high crit chance and is innately silenced,
> and is solid for most of the Star Chart.
>
> The Soma is a cross between an assault rifle and an LMG, a small spool
> up but high fire rate and good crit rate like the Baza, in addition to
> a high mag size.

-   **Shotgun - Hek *MR4* & Tigris *MR 7***

> The Hek and its variants are a great early game shotgun that don\'t
> require much to make it work. Good mag size and decent damage make it
> a good choice for early game. The Tigris is a double barrel pain
> train, fast reload speed and low spread are only a few things that
> make this shotgun good.

-   **Bow - Dread *MR5* & Rakta Cernos *MR12***

> The Dread is one of the easiest bows to get but it still packs a huge
> punch. With a single crit mod, high crit chance and slash damage. The
> Rakta Cernos on the other hand fires much faster than the dread, but
> has the puncture damage type which isn\'t as good as slash.

-   **Sniper - Rubico *MR6 &* Vectis *MR 2***

> The Rubico is a good all around sniper, boasting one of the highest
> crit multipliers of any gun, as well as a decent mag size. The Vectis
> and its Prime counterpart have the highest status of any sniper but
> have to be constantly reloaded.

#### Secondaries

-   **Shotgun - AkBronco *MR2* & Bronco *MR0***

> The Bronco and its dual series are the only pocket shotguns pre-MR7
> that are easy to get. It packs a punch with decent all rounder stats,
> with the exception of a really small clip. With the resources that are
> needed to craft it, Neurodes, Alloy Plates, Ferrite and Polymer
> Bundles, it's pretty feasible to obtain it early.

-   **Burst Pistol - Sicarus *MR3* & Kraken *MR 0***

> The Sicarus is a burst fire, highly accurate pistol that also has a
> good crit chance. The only downside to the Sicarus is the low mag
> capacity. The kraken on the other hand is a status pistol that fires a
> double shot on every trigger pull with the downside being high recoil.

-   **SMG - Afuris *MR2 &* Akstiletto *MR 8***

> Both secondary smgs that are recommended have fast fire rate, and they
> boast solid damage with good accuracy.

-   **Beam Weapon - Atomos *MR5 &* Nukor *MR 4***

> Both weapons are extremely good early game and have the potential to
> be taken into late game with certain mod loadouts.

#### Melee

-   **Polearm - Orthos (Prime) *MR2* & Tonbo *MR3***

> Both the Orthos and Tonbo have good range and are fast, great for
> clearing a group of enemies. They also have good status, and should be
> modded for slash procs.

-   **Whip - Lecta *MR0* & Atterax *MR2* & Scoliac *MR6***

> All whips are a great melee choice, as they have high attack speed and
> extremely long range with good damage.

-   **Hammer - Jat Kittag *MR5***

> Great with quick attacks, continuous use, finishers etc. High damage,
> moderate range.

-   **Greatsword - Galatine *MR3* & Gram *MR 2***

> Extremely high damage, very slow attack speed.

-   **Fist Weapon - Hirudo *MR7 &* Ankyros *MR 0***

> The Hirudo can deal lifesteal attacks and is extremely fast. The
> Ankyros is a gateway weapon that you need to turn into other fist
> weapons.

-   **Nikana - Nikana *MR4 &* Nikana Prime *MR 0***

> Overall great stats, especially attack speed and crit. Easily usable
> throughout any mission. Use it to finish off enemies easily, as it
> blends combat together very well. Moderate damage, speed, and range.
> The Prime version of the nikana is better in almost every stat but is
> just harder to farm for.

Q: Will the vault be reopened?

A: Yes, every \~3 months DE unvaults previously vaulted Warframes and
items, and vaults current ones. This is called Prime Unvaulting.

Q: How does vaulting work?

A: All relics that will be vaulted will be removed from drop tables.
Anything else you have, you will keep. This includes the relics
themselves, the items, parts and crafted items.

Companions
----------

There are 3 different types of companions that can accompany you and
your Warframe on missions. Each type has special precept mods that
provide unique abilities and passives. You may only have one active
companion at a time. Precept mods will be used most in the order they
are placed starting with the top left being the most used and the bottom
right being the least used.

### Beasts

There are two species of Beast companions, Kubrows and Kavats. They are
bred and managed in the Incubator segment of your Orbiter. Each new
Beast requires an Incubator Power Core, the blueprint for which is found
in the Market.

Only one Beast companion may be active and available to use at a time.
The others you own are stored in Stasis.

When a Beast companion is bred, it will appear as a puppy or kitten. The
Beast can be kept in this state indefinitely. It must be matured for
combat in order to take on missions.

Once a Beast is matured, it will degrade in DNA integrity each day,
affecting overall health, and loyalty, affecting damage. Applying a DNA
Stabilizer will increase DNA Integrity, and interacting with the Beast
will increase loyalty.

When breeding a Beast, imprints can be used instead of a random
incubation. Imprints are taken from an already existing Kubrow and
Kavat. A max of two imprints can be taken from every unique Beast. These
imprints can then be traded and/or reused. Two imprints are required to
breed a focused Beast. Depending on genetics from the original Beast,
you can determine the new Beast's gender, breed, size, and fur pattern.

The Nutrio Incubator Upgrade Segment can be obtained from the Clan Dojo.
It provides the following effects:

-   Instant Stasis Recovery

-   Free Stasis Recovery

-   DNA Stabilizer cost reduced from 75,000Cr to 5,000Cr

-   Egg Incubation reduced by a day

-   Daily DNA degradation reduced from 10% to 5%

#### Kubrows

Kubrows resemble large, sturdy canines. They are unique in that they lay
eggs instead of giving live birth. To breed a Kubrow, the Howl of the
Kubrow Quest must be completed, a Kubrow egg must be obtained, and the
Incubator segment installed. Kubrow eggs only drop from Kubrow Dens on
Earth. They can also be bought in the Market for 10p.

#### Kavats

Kavats resemble large, slim, and lanky cats. They roam wild in only the
Orokin Derelict. To breed a Kavat, 10 DNA strands and the Kavat
Incubator Upgrade segment must be obtained. The segment can be found on
Hyekka Masters, and the DNA strands must be scanned off of live wild
Kavats, or bought from the Market for 5p.

    > other companion.

### Sentinels

Sentinels are the first type of Companions available to the player. They
have varied precepts and weapons depending on the Sentinel used. Each
Sentinel will come with a Sentinel weapon, but that Sentinel is not
limited to using that weapon. They do not need to be maintained and
their weapons can be swapped in the arsenal, however they do take mods
from the same weapon types as primaries. This means that any mods used
on a rifle cannot be used on a Sentinel rifle.

### MOAs

MOA companions are a modular Companion introduced with Fortuna. They are
repurposed Corpus Proxies. All MOA part blueprints can be bought from
Legs for Standing.

MOAs are built from 4 different components - the Model, Core, Gyro, and
Bracket. There are currently 3 Models, 3 Cores, and 7 Gyros to choose
from, with only one Bracket. Models determine the MOA's precept mods,
the Core and Gyro determine additional health, shield, and armor buffs.
The Bracket determines the MOA's legs.

Each of the MOA Models can give 6k standing after Gilding.

Like [[Kit Guns]{.underline}](#kit-guns) and
[[Zaws]{.underline}](#zaws), MOA Companions must be Gilded in order to
further upgrade and customize them. Gilding requires a max level MOA, 10
Training Debt-Bonds, and 5k Standing. You cannot install a Potato or
Forma, or customize colors until the MOA is Gilded.

**MOA Models**

-   Lambeo - Defensive

Stasis Field - Creates a defensive bubble that reduces enemy projectile
speed and damage.

Shockwave Actuators - Occasionally emits a shockwave that knocks down
surrounding enemies.

-   Oloro - Tactical

Tractor Beam - Increases Warframe aim glide duration and reduces their
gravity.

> Security Override - Allows MOA to hack consoles, and gives it a chance
> to mind control robotic enemies within 30m after a successful hack.

-   Para - Offensive

Whiplash Mine - Deploys a mine that tethers all enemies in range. After
3s, all tethered enemies get pulled into the mine.

Anti-Grav Grenade - Fires a grenade that reverses gravity in an area,
inflicting Impact damage and causing enemies to float

upwards.

Note: MOA precept mods are not locked by type, meaning all MOAs can use
any precept mods.

Archwing
--------

Archwing is a unique mission type involving a special vehicle, called
Archwing. There are 4 different Archwing flight suits, and one Primed
one, along with a roster of primary and melee weapons. The Archwing suit
acts like a Warframe, with 4 unique abilities.

Archwing missions are spread throughout the Star Chart, and resemble
regular missions, such as exterminate, interception and mobile defense.
During these missions only Archwing abilities, weapons, and mods can be
used. Your Warframe and weapon loadout does not matter, and can't be
used. The only way to get Archwing mods is by doing Archwing missions.

Archwing parts and blueprints can be found in your Clan Dojo. Archwing
weapon parts and blueprints can be found in
[[Syndicate]{.underline}](#syndicates) reward tables.

Archwings:

-   Odonata - General use

-   Itzal - Speed and Defense

-   Amesha - Support and Healing

-   Elytron - Damage

The only Primed Archwing currently is Odonata Prime.

Archwing Primaries:

-   Cyngas - Burst fire

-   Fluctus - Plasma waves, punch through up to 250m

-   Grattler - Explosive shell based flak cannon

-   Imperator - Automatic hitscan rifle

-   Imperator Vandal - Variant with increased stats

-   Corvas - Chargeable shotgun blasts

-   Dual Decurion - Dual wield SMGs

-   Phaedra - Automatic hitscan rifle

-   Velocitus - Charge shot sniper weapon

-   Larkspur - Chain weapon with explosive projectile alternate fire.

Archwing Melee:

-   Centaur - Sword and shield

-   Veritux - Greatsword

-   Prisma Veritux - Variant with increased stats

-   Rathbone - Hammer

-   Agkuza - Hooked longsword

-   Kaszas - Large Scythe

-   Knux - Extendable fist gauntlets

-   Onorix - Greataxe

Gear
----

Gear items are buildable equipment that can be used in-game. Some
notable gear items include health, energy, and ammo restores, ciphers,
fishing spears, mining lasers, and Specters.

Q: How do I access my gear?

A: The default binding is "Q"

Q: How much gear can I bring along?

A: You have 12 main slots which can be hotkeyed, and infinite slots
after that which have to be rotated to in missions. Technically, you can
have every piece of gear with you on a mission. However, consumable gear
items have a limit to how many you can bring on one mission. For
example, ciphers max out at 200, so if you own 500, only 200 will be
delegated to your gear wheel in a mission.

Q: What should I normally bring?

A: Generally, bring ciphers (for hacking consoles), energy, health, and
ammo consumables (aka pizzas or pancakes), and codex scanners.
Everything else is determined by preference or need.

Q: What are Specters?

A: Specters are a deployable AI that can be used in missions. They will
follow and defend you until killed or the missions ends, or you can set
them to defend an area using \[E\]. Warframe Specter blueprints are
rewarded from Rescue missions, while other Specters come from
Syndicates. Warframe Specters can copy your loadouts, and will use the
weapons you assign them when deployed.

Mods
----

Collecting and upgrading your arsenal with mods allows for ultimate
customization. Mods appear as cards, and can be found, earned, and
traded in game.

Q: What are mods?

A: Mods are items that you can slot into your weapons, frames and
companions that augment stats or add additional effects. Modding can be
as simple as giving additional crit to a weapon, adding health to a
frame, or as complex as building a frame for a certain ability. Mods are
your power through the game, and are the reason why basically anything
will scale. Without them, you're immensely weak compared to the enemies
you face.

Q: Can I get more than x slots to hold mods?

A: There is no way to increase the amount of mods your Warframe/ Weapon
can hold, the only exception would be via Exilus Slots, however those
are only usable once.

Q: I have a brown mod, is there a silver or gold mod that's better than
it?

A: Better versions of any specific mods are uncommon. Mods are designed
to each have a unique ability. Instead of having better versions of a
mod, mods are upgradeable through fusion. However, all Primed mods are
direct upgrades to their non-prime counterparts.

Q: How does Status and Elements work? Are they optional?

A: Elements are very highly recommended, and Status procs are immensely
helpful. See [[Damage]{.underline}](#damage) for more information.

Q: Should I max 'x'? (Primed mod/mod/rank 10)

A: Generally, you don't need to max mods especially if you're starting
out. Getting to a R6-R8 is slightly better since it provides you more
bang for your buck. (See question right below why R6's don't need as
much Endo).

Q: How does mod ranking work?

A: A mod will have a base Endo and Credit cost according to its rarity
(Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary). This cost roughly doubles for
every rank that you upgrade it to, so it's exponential. This means that
the last 2 ranks of a R10 mod usually takes about 75% of the mod's total
cost.

**Endo Cost**

               0   1          2         3        4        5       6       7       8        9        10

  Uncommon     0   20         60        120      240      480     960     1,920   3,840    7,680    15,360

  Uncommon    0   966     2,898   6,762    14490    29946    60858     122682    246330    493626    988218
  Rare        0   1,449   4,347   10,143   21,735   44,919   91,287    184,023   369,495   740,439   1,482,327
  Legendary   0   1,932   5,796   13,524   28,980   59,892   121,716   245,364   492,660   987,252   1,976,436

By ranking something to R6, you get 7/11ths (63.63%) of the benefit for
only 6.25% of the cost. It's similar to R8, having 9/11th (81.81%) of
the benefit for 25% of the total cost.

Q: What's that mod slot right above the main modding slots on melee
weapons?

A: That's the stance mod slot. Think of it similar to an Aura for
Warframes. It gives you more mod capacity and changes the way that your
melee works in terms of combos and attacks.

Q: What are some of the important mods?

A: See charts below.

1,976,436 credits each to go from 0-10. It is recommended to save
Legendary Fusion Cores for Primed mods.

### How to Mod - Warframes

Muffin's over-oversimplified guide to modding Warframes. (Starchart
only, Endurance has some different builds for minmaxxing)

1.  Determine it's best stats, and what it's most suited for.

    a.  i.e. a Valkyr has high innate armor and health, but very little
        > shield.

    b.  Inaros has a tons of health, but no shields, so don't mod for
        > shields.

    c.  Volt generally has a ton of shields, so maxxing it, would be
        > helpful.

2.  Get your survivability mods.

    d.  These refer to mods which help you survive. If you feel that you
        > don't die too much feel free to skip.

    e.  Quick Thinking, Vitality, Redirection, Vigor, Steel Fiber,
        > Armored Agility, Adaptation, Health Conversion

    f.  If your job is to tank, or your abilities depend on either Armor
        > or Health, it's wise to mod for that first.

3.  Get your core mods.

    g.  These refer to the mods that make or break a certain build.

    h.  If your build calls for an augment, then that will be its core
        > mod. If it does not, then skip this section.

4.  Check the stats your skill needs then upgrade your Power Strength,
    > Range, Duration and Efficiency.

    i.  Determine which of the skills need the most modding. This
        > determines the order of how you'll mod.

        i.  Modding an EV means -Duration\>+Range\>+Strength where
            > efficiency doesn't matter too much.

        ii. A Hysteria Valkyr only benefits from +Efficiency and -Range,
            > +Strength should come second to that.

        iii. It's possible to get under 100% on any given stat. Play
            > around with your build to see which stats are less needed
            > than others.

### How to Mod - Weapons

1.  Start with your "mandatory" mods (Damage & Multishot)

2.  Check out the stats, if it's above 15% crit chance build for crit,
    > if above 15% status build for status

    a.  Hybrid builds exist, although it might be easier to forego and
        > focus on one side

3.  Build it either for Pure Damage, Crit, Status, Hybrid

    b.  Damage - Add Elementals, tons of them

    c.  Crit - Crit chance & Damage

    d.  Status - Preferably the dual stat elemental + status.mods

    e.  Hybrid - Mix and match until you run out of mod space

4.  If there are still slots not full, add utility mods, reload, punch
    > through and whatever else you might want.

### Riven Mods

Q: What are Riven mods? How do I unveil them?

A: Riven Mods are rare and powerful mods that appear as purple mod
cards. They start out as a veiled riven. You must complete the challenge
on the riven in order to unlock it. Riven mods come in 6 variants, each
a specific weapon type; melee, zaw, pistol, kitgun, rifle, and shotgun.
When the riven is unveiled, a random weapon of that type is rolled. With
the weapon comes a minimum of 2, and up to 4 random stats; a maximum of
3 positive stats and a maximum of 1 negative stat. Fusing the mod will
increase these stats, and all rivens cap at 8 fuses.

Q: How do I get them?

A: You get one by finishing TWW, the rest are via Sorties, Events,
Twitch Drops, or trading.

Q: What's this number at the bottom right of the Riven?

A: The number of times it has been rerolled using kuva.

Q: If I complete a Riven challenge, do I have to finish the mission?

A: No, you can abort the mission and still unveil the Riven if you have
completed its challenge.

Q: Does having a negative effect make the positives better?

Q: Does having multiple positives but no negative make them worse?

A: Yes, and yes. Positives and negatives are mixed and make a Riven
stronger than another. A riven with 2 positives and 1 negative gives the
strongest positives of that kind, while 3 positives with no negative
give the weakest positives of that kind.

Q: My Riven has a higher/lower X than his, is this a bug?

A: Rivens stats are completely random, and fall within a range of
possible numbers based on disposition. One riven might get +101.3%
damage and another might get +99.8% damage. This means that it's
virtually impossible to have a Riven that's exactly the same as another.

Q: How can I reroll Rivens?

A: Farm kuva from kuva siphon and flood missions, from kuva survival,
bounties, and Sorties, and reroll the riven in the mod menu.

Q: Can I continue to reroll it forever or is there a cap?

Q: Does the Kuva scale infinitely?

A: There is no cap to how many times a riven can be rolled. However, the
kuva costs will keep increasing until 9 rolls, where it caps at 3500
kuva.

Q: Can I reroll the weapon they're for?

A: No, but you can get Riven Transmuters to roll 4 unveiled rivens into
a new random veiled riven.

Q: Does the MR lock on the Riven mod do anything?

A: MR requirement is just that, an MR requirement. The riven cannot be
equipped until the player who owns it is the MR listed on the card. The
MR requirement on a Riven also raises the base Endo and credit trade-in
value.

Q: How do I trade a Riven?

A: Trading Rivens works just like all other trading. The MR requirement
on a Riven does not affect tradeability. However, players cannot receive
any type of riven until they are MR8, veiled or otherwise.

Q: If I own a veiled riven and a new weapon shows up, can it roll into
the new weapon?

A: No, a veiled riven obtained before a new weapon comes out will not
have the new weapon in its roll table.

Q: What are the various stats of the Riven?

A: See the table below. All of these stats can be both positive and
negative.

Asterisks show melee exclusive stats.

  Base Damage         Reload Speed      Dmg to Grineer    Channeling Damage\*
  ------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -------------------------
  Multishot           Punch Through     Dmg to Corpus     Channeling Efficiency\*

  Crit Damage         Zoom              Slash             Finisher Damage\*
  Fire Rate           Flight Speed      Impact            Crit on Slide\*
  Status Chance       Status Duration   Puncture          Range\*

  Magazine Capacity   Cold              Electricity       

Q: What are the best stats for a riven?

A: This depends on the weapon and your preferences, but it's generally
agreed upon that damage, multishot, crit chance, and crit damage are the
best. For melee weapons, crit on slide and range are highly sought after
as well.

Q: How to I display Rivens in chat?

A: Just type \[Riven Mod\] to bring up a screen or type the whole name
out with brackets \[Braton Lexicon\]

Q: What can and cannot change when you roll a Riven?

  **Can change**                             **Cannot Change**

Q: Can I get rivens for Zaws and Kit Guns?

A: Yes. Rivens are available for all the Zaw strike and Kit Gun
chambers. They will be displayed as Zaw Riven and Kitgun Riven.

**Trading and Loot**
====================

Trading is the act of swapping items and premium currency between
players in-game. Trading can be started through the Trade Chat, a
personal message, or some third party sites.

The requirements to trade are being at least MR2, and having access to
Maroo's Bazaar on Mars or a Clan Dojo.

Trading in *Warframe* is referred to as a Free-Market. This means the
developers of the game have no say or influence on the price of player
owned in-game items, besides the ones in the Market. Prices are entirely
dictated by the player-base, and will often change without notice
depending on rarity, availability, supply, and demand.

**Trade** Terms
---------------

You'll need to learn the way the traders talk!

As a general rule of thumb, format your posts. You can type them into a
browser or Notepad and paste them into the Trade Chat. The better
looking and legible your post, the higher chance someone will notice it.
Now that we have chat filters, it is immensely important that you spell
things correctly. For example, if someone has a filter of \[Nova Prime\]
Chassis, then having 'Nova P Chass' in your sale post will not trigger
it.

**Trading Etiquette**
---------------------

1.  Don't say WTB Plat, that's basically saying, "Want to buy
    > money/currency". Try selling something instead.

2.  If someone offers you something but you don't like it, say "No" or
    > "No thanks" don't leave other people waiting. If it seems decent,
    > try to haggle.

3.  When someone asks for something at a specific price, don't ask them
    > for offers. They already gave you a price

4.  Don't spam people if they don't reply immediately, odds are, they
    > might be in a mission or trading with someone else, or have
    > decided they're not interested. Around 3 minutes would be a good
    > time to reask.

5.  Do thank the buyer/seller. At the least, say it in chat.

6.  When buying something, don't ask multiple people for the same thing,
    > or inform them if you've already bought it.

7.  Haggling is fine, but If you've settled on a price, don't try to
    > change it.

8.  If you're the one hosting a trade, don't leave the dojo immediately
    > after it's done. Host Migration errors can sometimes force
    > restarts and delete traded items (even on your side). Wait for the
    > person to leave first as often as possible.

9.  The seller is the host. He/she will be the one to invite.

10. Do not try to work around other people's filters. For example, the
    > people that exclude WTB, generally don't want to buy anything, so
    > why waste your time trying to sell to them?

11. If you see someone saying PMO or Offers, don't reply with hm or how
    > much. That goes against the entire point of offers. Research the
    > item they're selling, and make them a fair offer.

12. Optional good deed - if you see someone selling something for well
    > below the accepted price, i.e. selling a Primed Mod for 10p, ask
    > them if they know the actual price of the item. If they don't,
    > tell them the item's current price. Otherwise you're setting them
    > up to get robbed.

**Trading**
-----------

Q: Where do I go to trade?

A: Maroo's Bazaar (on Mars) or in your Clan Dojo.

Q: What are tradable things?

A: Check this table

  **Tradeable**                                               **Not Tradeable**
  ----------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Relics and Keys                                             Built Warframes

  Mods (except daily reward mods)                             Potatoed / Forma'd/leveled Event/Syndicate Weapons
  Fish and Gems (not alloys)                                  Any parts for a non-Prime/specialized Warframe/weapon
  Event/Syndicate Weapons with 0 Affinity (no potato/forma)   Resources not involved with mining or fishing
  Prime Parts **UNBUILT**                                     Crafted Prime Parts
  Prime Blueprints                                            Cosmetics
  Landing Craft Blueprints **UNBUILT**

  Captura Backgrounds                                         

Q: Can I trade syndicate syandanas?

A: No, you can only obtain those for syndicates you've personally maxed
out.

Q: What is trading tax?

A: It's the tax on the buyer and seller on what they're trading. It's
usually pretty low, however some clans have a premium tax.

IT IS NOT A HIDDEN FEE, NOR IS IT HACKED IN.

Primed mods and legendary tier items (Legendary Core and Legendary
Arcanes) are the only items with 1M tax.

Q: Can you trade across regions?

A: Yes, as long as you can invite them to a Dojo or Maroo's Bazaar and
meet the trade prerequisites (mr2+ & have more than 1 trade) they can
trade with you.

Q: How many trades do I get?

A: You get as many trades as your MR. Your trade count will reset to
your MR at the Daily Reset.

Q: How many items can I trade?

A: You can trade up to 6 items per trade instance. Items (except
platinum) are not stackable and must be placed one at a time.

Q: Why does this item I'm trying to trade for say MR locked?

A: Many items, particularly Prime parts, are MR locked to players. This
means they are not buildable until the player reaches the MR shown for
the item. This also means you cannot receive items that are above your
MR level. Note that this only occurs for Prime blueprints, not the
individual parts of the Prime item. For example, if you are MR8, you can
receive the stock for Tigris Prime, but not the Tigris Prime blueprint.

Q: What is this blue text on the screen?

Q: How do I link items?

A: Simply try to type it with brackets \[\], a small popup will show you
what is allowed to be linked.

Q: How to I display Rivens in chat?

A: Just type \[Riven Mod\] to bring up a screen or type the whole name
out with brackets \[Braton Lexicon\].

**Platinum**
------------

Q: What is Platinum? And what do I do with it?

A: Platinum is *Warframe's* premium in-game currency, which means it can
be bought with real life currency and used in game. Its primary purpose
is for purchasing items, equipment, and cosmetics in the Market (it is
not recommended to buy items, as all items and equipment excluding some
cosmetics are farmable in game). Platinum can also be traded between
players, usually for items (see [[Trading]{.underline}](#trading)
above).

Q: Why should I pay money for Plat?

A: Technically you shouldn't, but if there's a particular
Warframe/weapon/cosmetic/equipment that you want immediately, then you
use Plat for that. Also, since *Warframe* is free to play and doesn't
run advertisements, buying Plat and premium cosmetics is Digital
Extreme's primary revenue source. So buying anything directly supports
the Devs.

Q: My first 50 Plat is untradeable, what gives?

Q: Why do I have untradable Plat?

A: Any starting Platinum will be untradable. This is to prevent account
creation for Plat farming. Most if not all other Plat that you earn will
always be usable for everything, including trading.

Q: What should I use my starting Plat on?

A: Generally, slots, potatoes (orokin reactors / catalysts) then
cosmetics in that order. You'll be able to get more Plat via trading
with others later.

A good choice is 1 Warframe slot (20p) and 1 Weapon slots (12x2=24) Thus
equaling 44 Plat.

Here's a basic priority list

-   Slots (Weapons and Warframe)

-   Potatoes (Get a good set of comfort weapons with potatoes)

-   Color Packs (Some good first palettes are the rest of Classic,
    > Classic Saturated, Tenno, and Orokin)

-   Cosmetics (These are visual changes only and offer no benefit to
    > gameplay)

-   Everything else; Weapons, frames, forma packs, etc.

Q: Should I buy Plat for the game immediately? I'm enjoying the game and
I want to help support it.

A: Go ahead and buy, however it's much better for you to wait for a 50%
or 75% discount from the daily login reward. But still, if you feel the
need to contribute, it's better for the game as a whole. Alternatively,
if you do want to support the game, the Prime Accesses are an option.

Q: How do I "earn" Plat? How do I "farm" Plat?

A: Plat is the in game premium currency and the only way to get it, is
to either buy it from DE with real money or trade for it. There is no
way to "farm Plat", in the strictest sense of the phrase. See
[[Trading]{.underline}](#trading) for ways to gain Plat through trading.

Q: Should I spend plat on rushing items in the foundry?

A: Short Answer is no. Taking the time and waiting for items to finish
building in the foundry is great incentive to take a break and helps you
not get burned out by rushing the game.

A: If you are stretched for time, or are generally impatient, then rush
what you think is important.

**Resources**
-------------

Q: Where can I get "x" resource?

A: Every planet has 4 set resources that can drop from enemies on that
planet's nodes.

Q: My booster isn't doing anything help!

Q: Difference between Resource Booster and Resource Drop Booster?

A: Resource Boosters will always apply a 2x multiplier to whatever
resource you get. This includes fishing, mining, and kuva missions. They
do not affect rewards from mission drop tables.

Resource Drop Booster doubles the chance resources will drop from
enemies, boxes etc. A Resource Drop booster will **not** double kuva.
Resource Drop boosters have no noticeable effect on fish or mining point
spawns.

Q: I farmed Argon Crystals and they're suddenly missing. What happened?

A: Argon naturally decays. It basically halves every day. So if you have
12 on the first day, on the second you'll have 6, then 3 then 2 then 1
then none.

Q: Where's the best place to farm x?

A: Generally the answer will always be the Dark Sector of the planet you
need the resource of, and if it doesn't have any, just do a survival.

Q: What are ducats?

A: Ducats are another form of currency in the game, however you can only
use them with Baro Ki'Teer, the Void Trader. You get ducats from going
to the relays and trading Prime parts in for them at the Ducat Kiosk on
either side of the central aisle.

Q: Can Kavats increase the amount of Kuva you get?

A: Yes, but only the Smeeta Kavat breed with the Charm mod has a chance
to double the Kuva you receive.

Void Relics
-----------

Void Relics are special, upgradeable containers that can be found
throughout the Star Chart. They predominantly drop Prime Warframe and
Weapon parts, but can also drop Forma blueprints.

Q: Where do I find relics?

A: Relics are a common drop on most endless missions. Relic packs can
also be bought from the Market and from all 6 main Syndicates. Relics
can also be traded between players.

Q: What does it mean for parts to be common and rare?

A: Every relic contains 3 common parts (bronze), 2 uncommon parts
(silver), and 1 rare part (gold). Common parts have a high chance of
dropping, uncommon have a moderately-low chance of dropping, and rare
parts have a low chance of dropping.

Q: What does refining a relic mean?

A: When doing Void missions, you collect Void Traces from dead Corrupted
enemies. You can use these Traces to refine a Void relic and increase
the chances of getting uncommon and rare drops, while decreasing the
chances for getting common drops. It takes 25 Traces for an Exceptional
relic, 50 for a Flawless, and 100 for a Radiant.

**Chances of getting one specific Drop**

                        Common Drops x3   Uncommon Drops x2   Rare Drops x1
  --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- ---------------
  Intact                25.55%            11%                 2%
  Exceptional (25 VT)   23.33%            13%                 4%
  Flawless (50 VT)      20%               17%                 6%
  Radiant (100 VT)      16.67%            20%                 10%

### Relic Drop Tables

All parts are essentially Prime, and thus will not have the "Prime" for
redundancy purposes. Simply search your desired part with no Prime
necessary. All lines indicated with red are vaulted until further
notice,

Item = In Rotation

Item = Vaulted

Factions
========

Friendly Factions
-----------------

There are a number of factions and people willing to help you on your
journey through the Solar System. These can include the factions listed
below, however Syndicates can be friend or foe, and aren't included
here..

### Tenno

The Tenno are you, the Warframes, under the care and guidance of the
Lotus. It is your privilege and your burden to keep the balance of power
in the Origin system.

### Ostron

The hardy people of the Plains of Eidolon, they've made a community in
the shadow of an abandoned Orokin tower and called it Cetus. They ask
you for assistance in their constant struggle against the Grineer. Talk
with Konzu.

### Quills

Led by Quill Onkko, the Quills study the sentients who still roam the
Plains. Onkko seeks your fighting prowess in getting closer to these
dangerous beings. Talk with Onkko.

### Solaris United

The people of Fortuna are forever enslaved in debt to their Corpus
overlords. The Solaris United have banded together to push back. These
cybernetically modified rebels request your help in furthering their
cause. Talk with Eudico.

### Vox Solaris

Where Solaris United is the face of the rebellion, Vox Solaris is the
hidden, anonymous personnel group that handles the underground dealings
and shady operations. Their true purpose is yet to be revealed. Talk
with Little Duck.

### NPC

There are a number of friendly NPCs throughout the game that provide the
Tenno with different forms of aid or services.

-   The Lotus - A mysterious being who guides Tenno on their journey.

-   Ordis - A Cephalon who assists in ship and mission operations.

-   Darvo - A Corpus rebel who resides in Relays. He sells various items
    > for Platinum at a discount from Market cost.

-   Baro Ki'Teer - Known as the Void Trader, he appears every 2 weeks on
    > a Friday with a large selection of items to buy for Ducats and/or
    > credits. He is the only in-game purveyor of Primed Mods and Prisma
    > Weapons.

-   Maroo - A shady thief who has a heavy interest in Ayatan artifacts.
    > She will buy your Ayatan Treasures for Endo.

-   Clem - One of Darvo's connections, he is an undercover soldier who
    > spies on the Grineer. Will give you unique missions.

-   Nora Night - Host of the Nightwave radio station.

Enemy Factions
--------------

The Solar System is awash with large, dangerous, fanatical groups that
all want to see the Tenno as a long forgotten memory.

### Grineer

The Grineer are a vast army of genetically modified, cloned humans, who
are plagued by debilitating defects from over extension of DNA. They are
born and raised into fanatical dedication to the two Grineer Queens, and
wish to exploit Warframes as superweapons. They use mass produced,
simple but deadly weaponry, and have heavy armor that can block the
majority of damage they receive. Grineer never use proto-shields.
Recommended to use puncture and corrosive damage types.

**Enemies to Prioritize**

-   Heavy Gunner - High armor, high health, high damage.

-   Hyekka Master - Very high armor, high health, can spawn up to 4
    > Hyekkas.

-   Bombard - Very high armor and health, fires homing rockets.

-   Napalm - Very high armor and health, fires incendiary grenades that
    > leave a burning orb on impact.

-   Manic - High armor and health, can teleport and ignore damage, very
    > high damage melee attacks.

-   Nox - Extremely high armor and health, wields a sticky grenade
    > launcher that applies toxin and cold procs. Only weak spot is
    > head, which is protected by a fortified glass helmet. Breaking the
    > helmet releases the noxious gasses within.

-   Prosecutor - The Grineer specialty unit, with very high health and
    > the only unit with a shield. There are 4 types of prosecutors,
    > each one uses a specific elemental shield, of heat, cold, toxin,
    > or electricity. Whichever element the shield is is the only damage
    > type that will hurt them.

**Grineer Controlled Planets**

-   Earth (including Plains of Eidolon)

-   Mercury

-   Mars

-   Ceres

-   Saturn

-   Uranus

-   Sedna

-   Kuva Fortress

-   Lua (contested)

### Corpus

The Corpus are slaves to their greed. The highest ranking Corpus leaders
are merchants and traders, who deploy an army of crewmen and moa proxies
to both work for them and fight for them. The Corpus prefer high tech
energy based weapons, and use high capacity, damage absorbing
proto-shields. Corpus units rarely if ever have any type of armor.
Recommended to use slash, impact, toxin, gas, radiation, and magnetic
damage.

**Enemies to Prioritize**

-   Nullifier Crewman - Deploys an energy bubble around them, which
    > stops or negates any Warframe abilities if exposed to it.

-   Comba/Scrambus - These units are taller than regular crewman, and
    > have specialized hover shoes allowing them to move very fast. They
    > have an aura around their helmets that disrupt Warframe abilities
    > and HUD.

-   Shield Osprey - A flying support unit, this osprey will regenerate
    > nearby allies' shields very quickly. Take out this unit before
    > engaging the rest.

-   Bursas - The Corpus specialty unit, there are three types of bursas,
    > which are a heavy defensive proxy. Each one sits low to the
    > ground, and has a shield equipped to its front which negates all
    > damage. It can only be damaged reliably from the back. Once it is
    > disabled, you can hack the console on its back and have it fight
    > for you.

**Corpus Controlled Planets**

-   Venus (including Orb Vallis)

-   Phobos

-   Jupiter

-   Europa

-   Neptune

-   Pluto

-   Lua (contested)

### Infested

The infested are the remains of Corpus, Grineer, and other biological
organisms that have been infected by the Technocyte Virus, a pathogen
that wiped out the ancient Orokin civilization. The Technocyte is a hive
mind, and relentlessly attacks anything that invades its spawning nests.
Nearly every unit attacks with melee, though a few units have ranged
attacks. Infested units have very high health, rarely armor, and never
have proto shields. They are weak to slash, puncture, heat, corrosive,
gas, and radiation damage.

**Enemies to Prioritize**

-   Volatile Runner - An orange Corpus crewman shaped infested that will
    > charge you and explode in a suicide bomb style.

-   Swarm Mutalist Moa - A blue and purple Corpus proxy shaped infested
    > that launches swarms of infested spores that cause minor damage
    > and reduce invisibility. Any infested units that hit the spores
    > gain armor.

-   Tar Mutalist Moa - A blue, red, and purple Corpus proxy shaped
    > infested that launches globs of bright yellow mucus, that slows
    > down enemies and causes heavy damage when in contact.

-   Ancient - A heavy infested melee unit, it comes in three types;
    > healer, disruptor, and toxic. The healer (green) provides damage
    > resistance to allies, the disruptor (dark green and pink) drains
    > your Warframe's energy, and the toxic (dark green and neon green)
    > creates toxic clouds that deal heavy damage and buffs allies'
    > toxin damage.

-   Juggernaut - The infested specialty unit, and arguably the most
    > dangerous unit in the game. It is a quadruped infested tank, with
    > armor so high that any damage done to the exterior does zero
    > damage. It has high damage ranged and charge attacks. The only way
    > it can be damaged is when it rears up on its hind legs. Its
    > stomach is its weak point.

**Infested Controlled Planets**

-   Eris

-   Orokin Derelict

### Corrupted

The corrupted are the remnants of the ancient Orokin civilization. They
are brainwashed, augmented forms of Corpus, Grineer, and Infested units,
roaming the abandoned halls of Orokin towers, protecting that which they
were programmed to. And they will defend their masters' homes savagely.

All corrupted act like their normal counterparts, but are upgraded with
higher health, armor, and shields. Their weapons are also upgraded to
Orokin Prime energy weapons. Each unit is still susceptible to their
faction's weaknesses. Corrupted units can only be encountered in the
Void, or Void Fissure missions.

Recommended to target the same enemy types of their original faction.

The only Corrupted controlled area is The Void.

### Sentients (SPOILERS)

The Sentients are ancient beings that were a large part of the
destruction of the Orokin Empire. They have several variants, and all
have either damage resistance or damage adaptation. They can be
encountered on the Plains of Eidolon, Uranus, and Lua. Some Sentients
include the [[Eidolons]{.underline}](#eidolon-hunting-spoilers) and the
[[Shadow Stalker]{.underline}](#shadow-stalker).

Syndicates
==========

Syndicates are Factions that can be joined by the Tenno, and provide
unique purchasable rewards. There are 6 main Syndicates, each with their
own goals, friends, and enemies. Each Syndicate considers 3 other
Syndicates as Allied, Opposed, or Enemy. The 2 remaining are neutral.

A Syndicate's standing is based on Reputation, and each Syndicate has
their own Reputation ranking system. You can join as many Syndicates as
you'd like, but keep in mind that if a Syndicate is Opposed or an Enemy
with another, then gaining Reputation with that Syndicate will lose
Reputation in the other. If your Reputation with a Syndicate drops below
0, you become an Enemy to them and they will periodically send out hit
squads to kill you in missions, much like Assassins.

To advance in a Syndicate, you must max out Reputation with each of the
5 levels. You gain reputation by equipping the chosen Syndicate's sigil
to your Warframe. Only one sigil may be equipped on a Warframe at a
time. A portion of the affinity you earn will then be converted into
Reputation. Each level will require an offering to advance. These
offerings range from credits, resources, potatoes, and Prime parts. Each
level unlocks more rewards from that Syndicate's reward table.

**Steel Meridian**

The Steel Meridian are made up of deserters and opposers to the Grineer
Regime. They constantly fight a guerilla war against them, and are sworn
protectors of the few colonies that still survive on Earth.

**Arbiters of Hexis**

The Arbiters of Hexis are a disciplined, dogmatic, ruthless cult of
warriors and clerics who seek justice and order in the Origin System.
They see the Tenno as the ultimate key to this goal.

**Cephalon Suda**

Suda is one of the ancient artificial intelligences created during the
Great War, a Cephalon. She despises violence and destruction, and her
thirst for knowledge is unparalleled. She finds the Tenno intriguing.

**The Perrin Sequence**

The Perrin Sequence are a splinter group of brilliant and powerful
merchants, who shun the Corpus to further their own goals. They wish to
bring prosperity and direction to the Origin System.

**Red Veil**

The Red Veil are an organization dedicated to destruction. They see mass
corruption all around them, and wish to heal the system through a great
and violent purge. Bound by honor to their cause, they do not regard
life as precious, but as an obstacle.

**New Loka**

New Loka are worshipers of the Human life and what it once was. They
wish to see the restoration of humanity and the repopulation of Earth.
Their belief is that humanity will rise once again and end the age long
conflict that plagues the Origin System.

**Syndicate Alignments**

  **Syndicate**       **Allied (+50% Rep)**   **Opposed (-50% Rep)**   **Enemy (-100% Rep)**

Because of these Alignments, it is recommended to ally with 3
Syndicates, the 3 on the left of the menu, or the 3 on the right, for
ease of use.

Q: What do syndicates do?

A: Syndicates allow Tenno access to their reward lists, which include
important things like Warframe/weapon augment mods, gear consumables,
relic packs, Archwing weapon parts, Spectres, unique Syndicate weapons,
Captura scenes, and more.

Q: Can I trade syndicate syandanas?

A: No, you can only obtain those for syndicates you've personally maxxed
out.

Q: If I drop below my rank after paying tribute, do I still have to pay
tribute again?

A: Yes, if you lose a rank then you will have to pay tribute to get it
back.

Q: Which is the best syndicate? What syndicate do I choose?

A: That's subjective, choose which one you like the most, or which one
you like the rewards for most.

Q: How many syndicates can I max?

A: 5, however that takes intense micromanagement. 4 is the easiest to
max without extreme effort. The combinations are as follows:

**Steel Meridian, Cephalon Suda**, Arbiters of Hexis and Red Veil

or

**Red Veil, New Loka**, Steel Meridian and Perrin Sequence

(Bolded are the ones most used to retain 4)

Keep the SM / RV sigil and do Ceph Suda / New Loka missions respectively

Q: Is there any downside to getting Syndicates mad/angry/negative?

A: The slighted Syndicate will occasionally send Death Squads after you,
similar to Assassins. You can tell which Syndicate is attacking from
flickering lights and a message from the attacking Syndicate. You also
don't have access to their rewards.

Q: What's the difference of the "x Squad" vs the "x Platoon"?

A: Just numbers, usually the squad has 6, while the Platoon has 12+.

Q: I joined this syndicate, but the other one has the mod I want. Can I
switch over?

A: Anytime. Just pay the tribute and advance to the other goal.
Alternatively you can just trade for the mod.

Q: If I reach my daily standing cap and do a Syndicate mission do I get
more standing?

A: Yes. Syndicate missions reward standing regardless of your cap.

Q: What do Insignia / Seed / Quittance / Datum / Medallion / Mark do?

Q: What do Defender Insignia / Bountiful Seed / Executive Quittance /
Intriguing Datum / Lawful Medallion / Honored Mark do?

Q: What do General Insignia / Flawless Seed / Partner Quittance / Genius
Datum / Maxim Medallion / Exalted Mark do?

Q: How do I find them? How do I get them?

A: Collectively, they're called Syndicate Medallions, and they can be
redeemed at any non Earth relay at their respective Syndicates for
standing in their particular syndicate. You can get them by doing
Syndicate missions, they usually spawn 8 per mission.

Q: How do I start earning standing with my Syndicate?

A: Start their initiation and receive their sigil. Go to your arsenal,
Warframe → appearance → regalia then choose the sigil. When equipped it
converts some of your affinity to standing. (Does not drain your
affinity for your equipment).

Q: Why did my Syndicate weapon suddenly explode?

A: All Syndicate weapons, and weapons that can be upgraded with a
Syndicate mod, have what is called a Syndicate Radial Effect. Each
effect gives buffs and damage depending on the Syndicate the weapon/mod
is from. To gain the effect, you must gain affinity with the weapon that
will then be converted into points and fill a gauge in the lower right
hand of your HUD. Once the weapon's gauge is filled, usually 1,000
points, the effect will be released and the gauge reset.

  **Syndicate**         **Effect Name**   **Damage Type**   **Restore Type**   **Temporary Buff**

Assassins
=========

An Assassin is a specialized enemy that can randomly appear in any
standard mission, similar to Syndicate Death Squads (mission exceptions
are Syndicate missions, Archwing missions, Free Roam missions, Arenas,
(Elite) Sanctuary Onslaught, and Assassinations). Assassins appear with
the sole intent of killing their target. Even if you have others in a
squad, an Assassin will only attack its target, unlike Syndicate Death
Squads which attack everyone. You can check which Assassin is after you
on the front page of your Profile, in the Marked for Death section.

Shadow Stalker
--------------

The Shadow Stalker is the most common Assassin. He will occasionally
mark you for death after completing any Assassination mission, of any
faction. This appears as a message in your Inbox. Once marked for death,
the Stalker has a chance to appear on any mission node or type at any
time.

The Stalker appears as a modified dark grey and orange Excalibur,
wielding a greatsword. He attacks similarly to Excalibur as well.
Similar to Sentients, the Stalker gains resistance to damage as it is
received. Switch up your tactics as you take him down. If the Stalker
succeeds in defeating his target, he will disappear without dropping any
rewards and the defeated player will need to be revived.

The Stalker has a chance of dropping a number of powerful weapons, mods,
landing craft parts, and resources.

Zanuka Hunter
-------------

The Zanuka is a proxy controlled by Alad V. It is an Assassin whose
death mark appears after completing 5 Invasions against the Corpus in a
row. It will only appear in missions where you are fighting the Corpus.

The Zanuka appears as a grey, medium sized proxy similar in size to a
Hyena, but smaller than a Jackal. It employs an automatic plasma gun and
a frost bomb, along with melee attacks.

Should the Zanuka Hunter damage its target enough, it will pounce upon
its victim and transport them to a holding facility, where a hidden
mini-mission will begin. You must escape Alad V's facility and recover
your confiscated equipment.

The Zanuka has a chance of dropping Detron blueprints and parts, Orokin
cells, and landing craft parts.

Grustrag Three
--------------

The Grustrag Three are a team of enhanced, insane Grineer
super-soldiers. They are an Assassin whose death mark appears after
completing 5 Invasions against the Grineer in a row. They will only
appear in missions where you are fighting the Grineer.

The Three appear as large Grineer Marines, with streamlined armor and
open helmets. They each employ different fighting tactics.

-   Leekter carries a large axe and flashbangs

-   Shik Talk uses a handheld rocket launcher and a riot shield

-   Vem Tabook carries a shotgun that fires electro-traps

Each of the Three also has a Carabus Sentinel, armed with a laser rifle.

Should the Three succeed in defeating their target, their Sentinels will
form a shield around the victim, preventing team revives. A Grustrag
Bolt will then be attached to the victim's Warframe. The Bolt reduces
that frame's damage against Grineer by 50%. A blueprint for a Bolt
Release will be in the victim's inventory upon leaving the mission.

The Grustrag Three have a chance of dropping rare mods, Brakk blueprints
and parts, Endo, and landing craft parts.

The Wolf of Saturn Six
----------------------

The Wolf is the most powerful of the inmates to escape the maximum
security Grineer prison, Saturn Six. He led the uprising that released
himself and his inmates on the Origin System. He can only be found and
defeated during Series 1 of Nightwave.

The Wolf appears as a very large Grineer individual, similar in look to
one of the Grustrag Three, but with different armor. He wields his Wolf
Sledge, and primarily uses melee attacks. He can also attack with energy
projectiles similar to that of Excalibur's Exalted Blade, and will
occasionally perform a spin attack that pulls any nearby Warframes to
him.

The Wolf has an extremely high amount of health and Alloy armor. He is
also completely immune to Status effects and Warframe abilities. It is
recommended to keep distance from him, and to use weapons with high
puncture and radiation damage.

The Wolf can appear in any player-based mission, and does not require or
have a death mark associated with him. His arrival is preceded by the
standard flashing lights and a wolf-like howl. He cannot appear in
Syndicate, Archwing, Arena, or Free Roam missions. He also cannot appear
in (Elite) Sanctuary Onslaught, Quests, Mastery Tests, Relays, or Dojos.
In addition, if another Assassin has already appeared or is set to
appear in a mission, The Wolf will not spawn.

Relays
======

Throughout the Star Map exists Relays, friendly outposts that all Tenno
can utilize. They appear as a mission node, and must have all missions
before it completed for it to be accessible.

Current Relays

-   Strata, Earth

-   Larunda, Mercury

-   Kronia, Saturn

-   Orcus, Pluto

Unique Relays

-   Maroo's Bazaar, Mars

Destroyed Relays

-   Vesper, Venus

-   Leonov, Europa

-   Kuiper, Eris

\*These relays pertain to the PC version of Warframe, not the console
versions.

Maroo's Bazaar is where you go to turn Ayatan Treasures into Endo. It is
also a public trading hub, but doesn't contain any elements of other
relays.

Relays are destroyed when a [[Razorback
Armada]{.underline}](#razorback-armada) or [[Balor
Fomorian]{.underline}](#fomorian-invasion) are not defeated.

Each Relay has a number of NPCs, interactables, and locations within
them. These include Syndicate NPCs, where you can trade in Syndicate
Medallions for Standing, Darvo and Clem, Cephalon Simaris' Sanctuary
(which includes the [[Simulacrum]{.underline}](#arcanes)), the Conclave
Access, a Navigation room, and Ducat trading posts. Every existing Relay
(besides the Bazaar) can be visited by Baro Ki'Teer on his biweekly
visit. Tenno cannot trade with each other in Relays.

Clans, Dojos, and Alliances
===========================

Clans
-----

A clan is a foundable group in-game that any player can join. All clans
have a Clan Dojo with many useful rooms that can be built. Clans also
contain the Trading Hub, allowing for trades to be done with anyone in
the Dojo.

The Research Labs only exist in Dojos, where over 180 weapon, Warframe,
and equipment blueprints can be purchased. These blueprints must be
researched using resources, which any clan member can donate.

**Labs**

-   Tenno Lab - Allows for research of Warframes and Tenno-based
    > weaponry.

-   Energy Lab - Allows for research of energy and Corpus-based
    > weaponry.

-   Chem Lab - Allows for research of firearm and Grineer-based
    > weaponry.

-   Bio Lab - Allows for research of elemental and Infested-based
    > weaponry.

-   Orokin Lab - Contains the Dragon Keys and Solar Rail parts (Solar
    > Rails are discontinued).

To start a clan, go to the Clan Tab in the Communication Menu. To join a
clan, a member of an already established clan with the recruiter
permission sends an invite to your inbox. Ask in Recruiting Chat or on
forums to find the right clan for you.

Clan leaders have the ability to create and submit a unique clan emblem.
This emblem can then be equipped on your Warframes and companions, in
the Regalia section of the Appearance tab.

Note that DE does not interfere with Clan affairs, all activity happens
between Clan members and staff.

There are 5 capacity levels for Clans, each one affecting maximum member
count and research costs.

-   Ghost: All clans start at this level, have a max member count of 10,
    > and has the lowest research cost.

-   Shadow: Max member count of 30, has 3x the research cost of a Ghost.

-   Storm: Max member count of 100, has 10x the research cost of a
    > Ghost.

-   Mountain: Max member count of 300, has 30x the research cost of a
    > Ghost.

-   Moon: Max member count of 1,000, has 100x the research cost of a
    > Ghost.

It is highly recommended to finish the research for a new clan while in
the Ghost or Shadow sizes, as obtaining resources at higher Clan levels
is extremely expensive.

A Clan can have up to 9 unique Hierarchies, with each one having access
to 11 roles. The Hierarchy names and roles can be customized by the Clan
Founder, or those with the Ruler role.

**Clan Roles**

-   Ruler - Can add/remove permissions of others.

-   Recruiter - Can invite people to the clan.

-   Regulator - Can kick member from the clan.

-   Promotor - Can promote members up to their own rank or below.

-   Architect - Can add new rooms to the Dojo.

-   Dojo Decorator - Can add new decorations to rooms in the Dojo.

-   Treasurer - Can use the Clan Vault and change the Clan Tax.

-   Tech - Can start a research project in labs.

-   Tactician - Can start research of Solar Rails and deploy them
    > (currently discontinued).

-   Chat Moderator - Can kick or suspend members from clan chat.

-   Herald - Can edit the Message of the Day (MOTD) for the clan.

-   Fabricator - Can purchase blueprints from clan labs.

The Clan Vault is a buildable decoration that allows any member to
donate credits, resources, or decorations to be used in research
projects or building projects. Anything put in the Vault cannot be
refunded, and cannot be used for any player's personal needs.

The Clan tax is a secondary trade tax that can be employed. Any credits
gained from the Clan Tax in a trade go into the Clan Vault. The Clan Tax
can be 0-100% of the regular trade tax.

As Clan Chat is the only available chat medium for a Clan, many Clans
use third party sites for communication. The most popular of these is
Discord. It is common for Clans who are recruiting to require a member
to also have a Discord account.

Alliances
---------

An Alliance is a group of clans. Alliances used to be able to battle
each other using Solar Rails to try to win Dark Sector Missions, but
that feature has since been removed. Currently the only benefits to
being in an Alliance is access to the Alliance Chat, and the ability to
donate resources to other allied clans. Alliances are created as large
communities for players to access and socialize in. Creation of an
Alliance is done in the Clan Menu. Like Clans, Alliances can have unique
emblems that can be equipped on your Warframes and companions.

Events
======

Events are limited time, cycling missions with unique rewards, mission
types, and lore. All events are scheduled, and once finished will
usually start again after a few months.

Fomorian Invasion
-----------------

The Fomorian Invasion is one of two constantly revolving events. Their
status is increased when a player completes a Grineer Invasion. Their
status can be viewed in the navigation menu.

A Fomorian is a massive Grineer battleship. During the event, Tenno must
defeat a Balor Fomorian, the strongest class of the ship.

When the event starts, a Fomorian Disruptor blueprint will be delivered
to your inventory. It must be built and equipped in your gear wheel.
Omega Isotopes are a required resource to build it, and these can be
farmed on whichever planet the Fomorian is orbiting. All players must
have an equipped Disruptor to start the mission. One Disruptor is used
per mission attempt.

This mission is Archwing only. It is recommended to have decent gear
before attempting.

Procedure:

1.  Approach Balor Fomorian while avoiding its laser cannon. Warning
    > signs will appear on HUD when the cannon is charged.

2.  Avoid the enemy units and Zeplens. Zeplens will try to trap you in
    > an impenetrable bubble to be targeted by the cannon. Destroying
    > the Zeplen allows for escape.

3.  Destroy the two shield generators on either side of the Fomorian's
    > fuselage.

4.  Fly into the Fomorian and active your Fomorian Disruptor to disable
    > the shields around its power core.

5.  Inflict as much damage as possible to the core for 30 seconds. The
    > 16 nodes around the core can be destroyed for an additional damage
    > multiplier.

6.  A warning signal will initiate, fly out of the Fomorian as quickly
    > as possible. You have 30 seconds before it explodes to get at
    > least 1400m away. However, only one Tenno needs to escape for the
    > mission to finish successfully.

7.  The damage dealt in a single run will be subtracted from the
    > Fomorian's total health. The event ends when the Fomorian's health
    > hits zero.

If the Fomorian is not destroyed by the time the event timer is up, the
closest relay will be destroyed by it.

Rewards:

-   Completing the mission 3 times results in 200,000 credits and an
    > orokin catalyst/reactor

-   Completing the mission once results in one reward from the Fomorian
    > drop table. This includes Endo, Imperator Vandal parts, and dual
    > stat elemental mods for Archwing.

Razorback Armada
----------------

The Razorback Armada is the second of two constantly revolving events.
Their status is increased when a player completes a Corpus Invasion.
Their status can be viewed in the navigation menu.

The Razorbacks are upgraded Corpus proxies. During the Event, the Tenno
must defeat as many of them as possible.

When the event starts, a Razorback Cipher will be delivered to your
inventory. It must be built and equipping in your gear wheel.
Cryptographic Alu is required to build it, and these can be farmed from
any Corpus Archwing mission.

All players must have the Cipher to start the mission. One Cipher is
used per mission attempt.

Procedure:

1.  Use Cipher to enter battle arena

2.  Disable laser barriers around borders of arena using consoles on
    > balconies to release Bursas

3.  Damage bursas, and hack them

4.  Wait for Bursas to incapacitate Razorback, then attack as normal.

5.  Repeat until Razorback is defeated

6.  With each successful run, the Armada health will go down. The event
    > ends when the Armada's health hits zero.

If the Razorback Armada is not destroyed by the time the event timer is
up, the closest relay will be destroyed by it.

Rewards:

-   Completing the mission 3 times results in 200,000 credits and an
    > orokin catalyst/reactor

-   Completing the mission once results in one reward from the Razorback
    > drop table. This includes Gorgon Wraith parts, puncture damage
    > mods, and dual stat heat elemental mods for Archwing.

The Pyrus Project
-----------------

The Tenno and Steel Meridian have banded together against Vay Hek and
Sargus Ruk to rebuild what was lost long ago.

This event was created to rebuild the Strata Relay orbiting Earth. It is
not known now if this event will be repeated.

![](media/image12.png){width="5.406299212598425in"
height="3.9531255468066493in"}

What to do:

-   Find and donate 30 Pyrus Essence. Can be dropped by Essence Carriers
    > on Earth, Mercury, Saturn and Ceres.

-   Defeat the Grustrag Three. The Three can spawn in any regular
    > mission on Earth, Mercury, Saturn and Ceres, but do not drop
    > anything from their reward table during the event.

-   Complete a Simaris Daily Synthesis Task

-   Contribute 5 Relay Struts. Reusable blueprint for the struts is
    > delivered on start of the event. Trembera Essence, required to
    > build the struts, can be found on Earth, Mercury, Saturn and
    > Ceres.

-   Win back the relay from Sargus Ruk

![](media/image5.png){width="8.510416666666666in"

Rewards:

-   Ember Reprise Noggle

-   Veiled Pistol [[Riven Mod]{.underline}](#riven-mods)

-   Zylok Pistol

Buried Debts
------------

The Buried Debts involves using coolant cells to seal Thermia Fractures
that have broken out across the Vallis. It also grants access to the
Exploiter Orb raid boss fight, where the parts for Hildryn can be
acquired.

### Thermia Fractures

Procedure:

1.  Kill a coolant Raknoid. These spawn around the Exploiter Orb.

2.  Pick up the coolant cell and take it to an open fissure on the
    > Vallis.

3.  Insert the cell and defend it while it seals the fissure.

4.  Remove the cell when the fissure is sealed and take it to the next
    > open fissure.

5.  Repeat until 4 fissures have been sealed, or the coolant cell is
    > destroyed.

Each sealed fissure will give one fissure point. Sealing four fissures
using one coolant cell will award three bonus points, for a total of
seven. Every four fissures sealed will give one Diluted Thermia (this is
influenced by boosters).

Rewards:

-   Buried Debts Emblem @ 5 points

-   Amalgam Shotgun Spazz and Amalgam Serration @ 25 points

-   Amalgam Barrel Diffusion and Amalgam Organ Shatter @ 50 points

-   Buried Debts Sigil @ 75 points

-   Opticor Vandal @ 100 points

### Exploiter Orb Fight

Procedure:

1\. (Requirements for fight) Collect at least one Diluted Thermia.

2\. Go into the cave at the end of the arch above Harindi Crater.

3\. Go through the door into Deck 12. The second closed door will be the
mission start point.

4\. Make your way into the facility. In the main room, on the upper deck,
right next to where the Vent Kid door would be in Fortuna, is a console.
Insert a Diluted Thermia to start phase one of the fight.

5\. The Exploiter will drop in from an opening in the ceiling, and cling
to the walls. Shoot the rocks supporting her to make her come down.

6\. Damage one of the four vents on her back. This will cause her to ice
over the remaining vents, making them impervious to damage.

7\. Pick up Thermia capsules from one of the three boilers on the ground
floor of the main room.

8\. Use \[ALTERNATE FIRE\] to throw the canister at the frozen vents on
the Exploiter. As soon as a capsule is thrown, shoot it with a weapon to
make it explode. The vent will now have less ice on it.

9\. Repeat steps 7 and 8 again to remove all the ice (two capsules per
vent). Destroy the vent using your weapons.

10\. Repeat steps 7-9 on the remaining vents.

11\. After a period of time, the Exploiter will jump up onto the middle
balconies and hang suspended, unable to be damaged. She will then spawn
Coolant Raknoids to attack you. Kill the Raknoids and wait for her to
come down.

12\. Destroy the last of her vents.

13\. The Exploiter will escape to the outside. Leave Deck 12 from the way
you came.

14\. The Exploiter will spawn outside the entrance to the cave, and phase
two of the fight will begin. A small gauge will appear underneath your
minimap. This is her heat sensor. It must be fully filled to damage her
again.

15\. Kill Coolant Raknoids that approach the Exploiter to keep them from
cooling her systems.

16\. The Exploiter will occasionally slam her torso on the ground,
creating Thermia fractures. Pick up Coolant Capsules from slain Raknoids
and place them in the fractures to create Thermia capsules. As in step
8, throw these at the Exploiter and shoot them to increase her
temperature. It is best to aim for her leg joints and central turret.

17\. Once her temperature gauge is completely filled, jump onto her body.
An animation will play showing your Warframe removing one of her
processing units.

18\. Damage the area where you removed the processing unit.

19\. Repeat steps 15-18 for the second processing unit.

20\. Repeat steps 15-18 for her central processing unit.

21\. Once the third unit is removed and the area destroyed, the Exploiter
is defeated. Loot will drop from the back of the Orb.

22\. Once the loot is dropped, the Exploiter will self-destruct after 10
seconds, downing anybody in range. It is recommended to let the Orb
explode before collecting the loot.

23\. Return to Fortuna.

It is recommended to bring quick frames to navigate the large fighting
area of the second phase. It is also recommended to bring secondary
weapons with either high fire rates or spreads to make shooting the
Thermia capsules easier.

Due to the Exploiter's cold-based attacks, it is recommended to use the
Insulation mod and/or Arcane Warmth to resist the slowing effects.

During the first phase, the Exploiter will continuously spawn swarms of
the small raknoids. Bring an AOE frame or AOE weapon to deal with them
easily.

Rewards:

-   One of Hildryn\'s parts (Chassis, Neuroptics, or Systems)

-   One Lazulite Toroid

-   Random assortment of Fortuna based items, including parts from fish,
    > gems, minerals, and spores

-   Exploiter Orb Articula

-   Shocking Step Ephemera Blueprint

Expansions
==========

Plains of Eidolon and Cetus
---------------------------

The Plains of Eidolon is DE's first open-world expansion for *Warframe*.
It features a large, explorable, non-procedurally generated map with
tons of activities and missions to do, along with an all new Relay in
the form of a town. The Plains are controlled by the Grineer.

Q: How does one get standing?

Q: Why are there no sigils for me to equip for standing?

A: Do bounties (essentially PoE missions), fish or mine. The former
gives straight up standing, while the latter gives resources you can
trade for standing.

Q: What is that massive thing that roams around at night? Can I kill it?

Q: Can I kill the large thing that moves around at night?

Q: What are the small blue things that roam around at night? Why can't I
damage it after awhile? **(SPOILERS)**

A: Those are all sentients, and you need your Operator to kill them.
They drop cores, which are used to trade for standing at the Quills.

Q: What are the Quills, and where are they? **(SPOILERS)**

A: You need to have finished the quest Saya's Vigil first. Go to Hok's
anvil and take the path around the left, when you see the rocks, hug
them until you see a door similar to TWW, go into Operator Mode and the
door will open.

Q: What are those small things that float around?

A: If these are the ones you're talking about, they're Cetus Wisps. You
cannot hurt or scan them, but you can pick them up by walking on/through
them. They're used as a
resource.![](media/image2.png){width="0.7864588801399826in"
height="0.4791666666666667in"}

Q: Where do I obtain 'x'?

A: Odds are it's all fishing/mining parts. Otherwise it's a resource
found on the Plains in plants or containers. Just try your hand in those
and see where it leads. (See lists below)

Q: How do I exit the Plains?

A: Go out the way you came. Go back to the door to Cetus and it will
load you back into the town.

Q: What's this Ghoul Purge alert?

A: The Ghoul Purge is a mini-event for the Plains of Eidolon that comes
around every couple of weeks or so. It adds two new bounties to Konzu's
list, and spawns the Grineer Ghoul enemy on the Plains. These bounties
and enemies have unique rewards, weapons, and lore that can be looted
and found.

### Plains Bounties

Bounties are offered by Konzu. There are 5 different levels available,
each with increased difficulty, more Standing, and better rewards. The
Bounty board will change every 24 hours. A Bounty mission can be
repeated while it is active to gain its reward drops, but after doing it
the first time, you will no longer gain Standing for that level of
mission. Each Bounty will range from having 3 to 5 tasks in order to
complete the Bounty, depending on difficulty. After each task, a reward
will be given. You can leave the Plains in the middle of a Bounty and
still receive the rewards gained so far.

### Plains Fishing

Fishing is an activity done at nearly any water source in the Plains. It
provides resources and standing for the Ostron.

Q: How do I fish?

A: Go get a spear from Fisher Hai-Luk near the start of Cetus, and equip
it in your gear wheel (only one spear needs to be present in the wheel,
the other spears, bait, and dye are included with it). Stand by any body
of water in the plains with the spear out and listen. When you hear a
bubbling noise, start looking. When you see a fish, simply spear it.

Q: Are the dyes worth it?

A: Yes. Dyes illuminate fish in fishing sources, and last for 3 minutes.
Being able to see fish helps you learn how they swim and where they
spawn, which is invaluable experience. It also helps immensely when
fishing at night.

Q: How does bait work?

Q: How long does bait last?

A: It simply increases the spawn rate, making fish spawn more often when
the bait is out. It also increases the spawn rate of much rarer fish, of
which some still spawn without bait, and some that spawn only with bait.
Throw bait into hotspots, which are small white bubbling patches on the
surface of the water, that move around constantly. Bait lasts 3 minutes,
and do not work outside hotspots.

Q: Is there any benefit to getting more spears?

A: Yes, each fish is weak to a certain spear, and can be one-hit by it.
Using the wrong spear on a fish will cause it to only take damage, and
additional hits are needed for a successful catch.

Q: Does the resource booster work with fish?

A: Yes. Having a resource booster will give two fish for every one
caught. However, having a resource drop chance booster has no radical
effect on fish spawns.

Q: Why are the fish different sizes?

A: There are 3 different sizes of fish; small, medium and large. Each
size increase gives slightly more resources than the last, and are worth
more standing.

Q: Why can't I find a certain fish?

A: It's probably because you\'re either using the wrong bait, or you're
looking for the fish at the wrong time of day. Check the chart below if
you're still lost.

Q: What do you get from fishing?

A: Fish give resources necessary for making many Ostron items, and can
be a source of standing for the Ostron. Each fish has their own unique
resource drop, but all drop fish scales, fish meat, and fish oil.

\*Note: Cetus fish cannot be caught with Fortuna spears, but Cetus
spears will capture a damaged fish in Fortuna. The Fortuna Stunna spear,
however will shock Cetus fish into submission.

\^Note: Peppered bait will attract any fish that are active during the
day, but is usually not needed.

### Plains Mining

Mining is an activity that can be done anywhere on the Plains. It
provides resources and standing for the Ostron.

Q: How do I mine?

A: Obtain a mining laser from Old Man Suumbaat in Plains of Eidolon (a
pickaxe icon on the map), and equip it in your gear wheel. When
equipping it on the plains; a new UI will appear. On the left, number of
ores in range, on the right, how far or close you are to an ore. Simply
listen to the beeping, the faster it gets the closer your crosshair is
to the ore. Red streaks on rocks are ores, blue streaks are gems. When
you see one, aim, and a series of glowing spots will appear on the ore.
Hold down the Fire button, and try to get the rising gauge into the
middle of the white box, and release (see picture below). The closer the
gauge is to the middle of the box, the better the mining rating.

![](media/image8.png){width="1.1510422134733158in"
height="0.9360115923009624in"}

Q: What is the mining rating?

A: The mining rating is what appears when you finish mining an ore spot.
It is rated on a scale of 5. It is based on how well you match the gauge
to the white boxes. The higher the rating, the more resources are
gained. A perfect rating of 5 will give double the typical resources,
and has a chance of additionally dropping a rare gem on blue spots.

Q: Why do some spots have two boxes, one big and one small?

A: The small box is an optional hitbox to the larger one. If it is
successfully hit, a rare gem is guaranteed upon completing the mining
spot.

Q: Are there any differences between the mining lasers?

A: Each laser has a different range to detect ores, with the standard
being 20m, the focused being 40m, and the advanced being 60m. Only the
advanced laser can trigger the smaller optional hitboxes to obtain rare
gems. {The Fortuna mining laser can also be used, and acts identically
to the advanced laser).

Q: Why are the ores and gems I'm getting different from the ones I need
in my blueprint?

A: The ores and gems you mine are the unrefined versions. You have to
obtain blueprints from Suumbaat to refine the base resources into usable
resources.

Ores in Plains

-   Auron

-   Coprun

-   Ferros

-   Pyrol

Gems in Plains - Standing

-   Azurite, Devar - 50

-   Veridos - 75

-   Crimzian - 100

-   Sentirum, Nyth - 400

### Zaws

A Zaw is a modular melee weapon with customizable stats influenced by
the parts used to build one. Most Zaw parts blueprints are bought with
Standing from Hok in Cetus. The rest are obtained from [[Plague
Star]{.underline}](#plague-star). Your Ostron Standing determines which
parts are available.

Zaws are made from 3 parts - the Strike, Hilt, and Link. One of each of
these is needed to build a Zaw, along with a small amount of Credits.
The Strike determines the damage of the Zaw, the Hilt determines the
type of weapon, and the Link determines the modifiers of speed, damage,
crit chance, and status chance.

Every Zaw Strike can give 3k MR, but must be Gilded first. Gilding a Zaw
is done by Hok, and requires a level 30 Zaw. Gilding costs 5k Standing
and 2 Cetus Wisps, and slightly increases its base stats. A Zaw cannot
be upgraded with a Forma or Potato until it is Gilded.

Plague Zaw parts only come from the Plague Star reward tables, and are
not purchasable from Hok.

### Eidolon Hunting (SPOILERS)

Eidolons are huge sentients that roam the Plains at night. They are a
very difficult enemy and should not be taken lightly.

Q: How does one hunt an Eidolon?

A: Procedure:

1.  Get Eidolon lures (2 for Teralyst, 3 each for Gantulyst and
    > Hydrolyst) and power them up by killing Vomvalysts (until they're
    > ethereal, being near the lure sucks them in) or by killing the
    > vomvalyst and picking up the small orb it drops, and delivering it
    > to the lure. Skipping this step makes the Eidolon teleport when
    > you destroy a weak point, and denies a brilliant eidolon shard at
    > the end of the fight.

2.  Break the Eidolon's purple shield with your Operator's amp, until
    > the Eidolon flashes red.

3.  Shoot with normal weapons the weak spots, or Synovias. The
    > Teralyst's are located on its biceps and knees. The Gantulyst and
    > Hydrolyst are similar, but have 6 Synovias, with additional ones
    > being located around the shoulder joints. Only one may be
    > destroyed at a time, and damage done to other Synovias do not
    > carry over.

4.  Once a Synovia is destroyed, the Eidolon will fall to its knee and
    > emit a 5 pulse magnetic wave, and will then regenerate its shield.
    > Repeat step 2\~3 until all Synovias are destroyed.

5.  Once all Synovias are destroyed, the Eidolon will lay down and emit
    > a scream, attracting Vomvalysts to its location. Destroy the
    > Vomvalysts as they approach, as the more that fuse with the
    > Eidolon, the more health it will have in the final battle.

6.  When the healing phase is complete, the Eidolon will stand, and
    > continue to attack. At this point, any part of the Eidolon can be
    > damaged by normal weapons. Damage it until its health bar
    > disappears. This ends the hunt and rewards are spawned.

Q: What attacks does the Eidolon use?

A: All 3 Eidolons have a set list of attacks:

-   Ground Stomp - Sends out a yellow pulse that pushes back Warframes
    > and Operators up to 100m. Can be avoided by jumping.

-   Gun Swing - Quickly sweeps its arm in a 270 degree arc, while
    > shooting out blue projectiles from its hand that explode on
    > impact.

-   Ground Smash - Stomps down on the ground, emitting glowing blue
    > streaks in the ground that will damage and stagger. This attack
    > can track you.

-   Seeking Bullets - Emits a ball of energy above its head, which then
    > splits into many small blue seeking missiles.

-   Tree Swing - Quickly swings its arm in a wide arc. Deals heavy
    > damage and knocks down.

-   Star Fall - Raises its arm upward and fires into the sky, causing a
    > rain of seeking projectiles to fall down.

-   Energy Spikes - Upon destruction of a limb, the Eidolon will emit 5
    > wave pulses of magnetic energy. High damage and removes all
    > Warframe energy.

The Gantulyst and Hydrolyst have addition attacks. The Gantulyst gains
alternate laser attacks and a large shield, and can easily destroy
lures. The Hydrolyst gains alternate lightning attacks and can create
Vomvalyst spawning portals.

Q: What Warframes do I use to hunt an Eidolon?

A: Warframes that provide innate damage boosts or give passive abilities
to allies, like Rhino and Harrow, are the best to use against the
Eidolons. Healing frames like Trinity and Oberon are useful in keeping
allies alive and protecting the lures. Damage frames like Mesa and Saryn
cannot target the Eidolon Synovias, and should not be used. Melee frames
like Wukong and Atlas should also be avoided, as the Synovias are very
difficult to hit with melee attacks.

It should be noted that shooting through Volt's shields will double Amp
damage.

Q: What Weapons do I use to hunt an Eidolon?

A: Any weapon with high burst damage, such as DMRs (Latron, Tiberon) or
Snipers (Lanka, Rubico). Eidolons have Alloy Armor, and are weak to
Radiation damage, so mods and weapons that provide Radiation are highly
recommended. Weapons with low range, such as Shotguns or Beam weapons
are not recommended, due to the danger and bad angle of getting close to
the Eidolon. Automatic weapons are not recommended, due to the Eidolon's
erratic movements making consecutive shots difficult, lowering DPS.

Q: What Amps do I use to hunt an Eidolon?

A: The old meta is the 2 2 3 Amp, the Schwaak, Shraksun, and Lohrin. The
new meta after Fortuna update 2 is 6 2 7, the Lega, Shraksun, and
Certus. Otherwise, any Amp combination other than the Mote Amp will work
when hunting Eidolons.

Q: The Eidolon got its shields back while fighting it, what gives?

A: The Vomvalysts can regenerate the Eidolon's shield when not dealt
with. Make sure to kill them when you see them.

Q: How does one do a Tridolon?

A: It's the same as the above, only you fight 3 Eidolons instead of one.
To spawn the next Eidolon, go to the shrine on the final rock on Gara
Tote Lake, and place the Brilliant Eidolon Shard from the previous fight
on the shrine. Once all players in the instance place their shards, the
next Eidolon will spawn in the water in front of the rock. Keep in mind
the other two Eidolons require 3 lures to capture and have 6 Synovias to
destroy, along with different attacks.

Q: What does killing an Eidolon give?

A: Defeating an Eidolon in any way awards an Eidolon Shard and a number
of Sentient Cores, usually around 20-30. Capturing an Eidolon awards a
Brilliant Eidolon Shard. Capturing a Hydrolyst awards an extra Brilliant
Eidolon Shard. Capturing a Gantulyst or Hydrolyst also awards a Radiant
Eidolon Shard. All 3 Eidolons have a chance to drop a physical damage
mod for weapons, and an Arcane from the standard Arcane list. Teralysts
have a very low chance to drop a rare Arcane, a low chance to drop an
uncommon Arcane, and a high chance of dropping a common Arcane.
Gantulysts and Hydrolysts have a moderate chance to drop rare Arcanes, a
high chance to drop uncommon Arcanes, and a low chance to drop common
Arcanes. The Gantulyst and Hydrolyst also drop one Riven Transmuter
each.

Q: What do I do with Eidolon shards?

Q: What do I do with Brilliant/Radiant Eidolon shards?

A: Regular Eidolon Shards are used in ranking up with the Quills, and
for crafting some blueprints.

Brilliant Eidolon Shards can be converted into 25,000 focus for your
current school, or used to unlock Waybound Nodes.

Radiant Eidolon Shards can be converted into 40,000 focus for your
current school.

### Amps (SPOILERS)

Amps are a modular weapon wielded by your Operator. They replace the
default void beam that is used after The War Within. Amps and their part
blueprints are obtained from Quill Onkko in Cetus.

Amps are built using three parts - the Prism, Scaffold, and Brace. The
Prism determines primary fire, the Scaffold determines alternate fire,
and the Brace gives augments and passives. The Mote Amp is the default
Amp, and can be built as one complete unit. It fires similarly to the
void beam.

**Amp Prisms**

  **Tier**   **Name**   **Description**
  ---------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1          Raplak     Semi auto, accurate long range void beams.
  2          Schwaak    Semi auto, limited range, wide angle flak blast, has innate Punch Through.
  3          Granmu     3 round burst arcing void grenades, explodes on impact.
  4          Rahn       Rapid fire automatic void beams.

**Amp Scaffolds**

  **Tier**   **Name**   **Description**
  ---------- ---------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1          Pencha     Chargeable void beam.
  2          Shraksun   Double shot short range flak grenade, explodes on impact or at range limit.
  3          Klebrik    Continuous tendril of void energy, seeks and connects to nearest target.
  4          Phahd      Powerful glaive shots seek and bounce off targets.

**Amp Braces**

  **Tier**   **Name**   **Description**
  ---------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1          Clapkra    +40 Amp energy pool
  2          Juttni     -1 second Amp Recharge delay
  3          Lohrin     +12% Amp Crit and Status chance
  4          Anspatha   +20% Amp energy pool, -0.5s Amp Recharge delay, +45/s Energy recharge rate

Numbers represent Amp level. Each set of Prism, Scaffold, and Brace are
unlocked as Quill Ranking progresses. So the first set unlocked are
considered the 1 1 1, the second set are 2 2 2, and so on. When making a
mixed Amp, numbers are mixed and ordered as needed, such as 3 2 4, which
is the third Prism, the second Scaffold, and the fourth Brace. All Amps
are referred to in this number system, for speed and convenience.

Amps are primarily used for fighting Sentients, as Void damage ignores
Sentient damage resistance. Also, the Eidolon's shields are only
affected by Operator Amps. For this reason, the most commonly used Amps
are X 2 3, as in any Prism, the Shraksun Scaffold, and the Lohrin Brace,
as this combination provides the most damage when hunting Eidolons. In
addition, Amps can be used to destroy Kuva Clouds in Kuva Siphon
missions.

Amps, like Zaws and Kit Guns, can be Gilded for a slight increase in
stats, and the ability to apply custom colors and Arcanes. Each of the
Prisms will provide 3k MR after Gilding.

Orb Vallis and Fortuna
----------------------

Fortuna is *Warframe's* second and most recent open-world expansion. It
features another large, open map that is not procedurally generated. Orb
Vallis' map is roughly 5 times the size of Plains of Eidolon, and
features many of the same activities. Orb Vallis is controlled and
operated by the Corpus.

### Vallis Bounties

Bounties are offered by Eudico. There are 5 different levels available,
each with increased difficulty, more Standing, and better rewards. The
Bounty board will change every 24 hours. A Bounty mission can be
repeated while it is active for its reward drops, but after doing it the
first time, you will no longer gain Standing for that level of mission.
Each Bounty will range from having 3 to 5 tasks in order to complete the
Bounty, depending on difficulty. After each task, a reward will be
given. You can leave the Vallis in the middle of a Bounty and still
receive the rewards gained so far.

### Vallis Fishing

Fishing is an activity done at nearly every water source in Orb Vallis.
The servofish found in these sources can be used for resources, or
traded for Fortuna Standing.

The process of hunting for fish remains largely the same as the Plains
of Eidolon, however the spear technique is slightly changed. Once you
hit a servofish, a horizontal gauge with a red target box appears, with
a line moving from left to right. You must press the \[FIRE BUTTON\]
when the line is within the box to shock the fish, allowing you to
collect it. If you miss, the fish will be set free, and you must spear
it again.

Q: How do I fish?

A: Talk to The Business in Fortuna and buy the Shockprod fishing spear
for 500 Standing, equip it in your gear wheel, and pull it out near a
water source in the Vallis.

Q: Do Cetus Dyes work in Fortuna?

A: Yes, they work the exact same.

Q: How does bait work?

Q: How long does bait last?

A: It simply increases the spawn rate, making fish spawn more often when
the bait is out. It also increases the spawn rate of much rarer fish, of
which some still spawn without bait, and some that spawn only with bait.
Throw bait into hotspots, which are small white bubbling patches on the
surface of the water, that move around constantly. Bait lasts 3 minutes,
and do not work outside hotspots.

Q: What's the difference between the Shockprod and Stunna Spear?

A: The Stunna spear works the same as the Shockprod, except when you
successfully shock a fish, any nearby fish are stunned by its blast for
a short period of time (about 30 seconds). These fish will slowly float
and can't be startled, and when speared, their target box is twice as
large as normal. (This effect works on fish in the Plains, however the
target fish will not be successfully speared).

Q: Does the resource booster work with fish?

A: Yes. Having a resource booster will give two fish for every one
caught. However, having a resource drop chance booster has no radical
effect on fish spawns.

Q: Why can't I find a certain fish?

A: It's probably because you\'re either using the wrong bait, you're
looking in the wrong water biome, or you're looking for the fish at the
wrong temperature time. Check the chart below if you're still lost.

Q: What do servofish points mean?

A: There are 3 different kinds of servofish; basic, adorned, and
magnificent. Each type increase gives slightly more common resources
than the last, and are worth more standing.

Q: What do you get from Fishing?

A: Servofish give resources necessary for making many Fortuna items, and
can be a source of standing for Fortuna. Each servofish has their own
unique resource drop, but all drop scrap.

### Vallis Mining

Mining in Orb Vallis is identical to mining in the Plains. A cutter
drill is required to be equipped in your gear wheel in order to mine.
Fortuna and Cetus cutters will work in either location. Mining provides
resources that can be used in building items from Fortuna or traded for
standing.

Q: How do I mine?

A: Obtain a mining laser from Smokefinger in Fortuna, and equip it in
your gear wheel. When equipping it on the Vallis; a new UI will appear.
On the left, number of ores in range, on the right, how far or close you
are to an ore. Simply listen to the beeping, the faster it gets the
closer your crosshair is to the ore. Red streaks on rocks are ores, blue
streaks are gems. When you see one, aim, and a series of glowing spots
will appear on the ore. Hold down the Fire button, and try to get the
rising gauge into the middle of the white box, and release (see picture
below). The closer the gauge is to the middle of the box, the better the
mining rating.

![](media/image8.png){width="1.1510422134733158in"
height="0.9360115923009624in"}

Q: What is the mining rating?

A: The mining rating is what appears when you finish mining an ore spot.
It is rated on a scale of 5. It is based on how well you match the gauge
to the white boxes. The higher the rating, the more resources are
gained. A perfect rating of 5 will give double the typical resources,
and has a chance of additionally dropping a rare gem on blue spots.

Q: Why do some spots have two boxes, one big and one small?

A: The small box is an optional hitbox to the larger one. If it is
successfully hit, a rare gem is guaranteed upon completing the mining
spot.

Q: Why are the ores and gems I'm getting different from the ones I need
in my blueprint?

A: The ores and gems you mine are the unrefined versions. You have to
obtain blueprints from Smokefinger to refine the base resources into
usable resources.

Ores in Orb Vallis

-   Axidite

-   Travoride

-   Venerol

-   Hesperon

Gems in Orb Vallis - Standing

-   Phasmin, Noctrul - 50

-   Goblite - 200

-   Amaryst - 500

-   Zodian, Thyst - 1000

### Animal Conservation

With Fortuna comes a new activity, animal conservation. The Business
offers new gear items called Echo Lures that can mimic the calls of
endangered wildlife that roam the Vallis. Track, call, and tranquilize
the animals to save them.

**Procedure**

-   Buy a Tranquilizer Rifle from the Business with 500 Standing.

-   Buy an Echo Lure from The Business with Standing.

<!-- -->

-   Equip the Tranq Rifle to your Gear Wheel. The Lures will be included
    > with it.

-   Equip your Tranq Rifle in the Vallis. New purple points will be
    > added to your map. These are animal tracking points.

-   Find a point and activate it.

-   Follow the faintly glowing tracks to the rainbow colored rock. This
    > is the call point.

-   Use the correct lure by pressing and holding the Fire Button. Move
    > your viewpoint up and down to change the pitch.

-   The animal will call back. Match its call by using your Lure to emit
    > a pitch that stays in the white box.

-   If successful, pull out your Tranq Rifle and zoom in. The rifle will
    > emit a seeking pulse that will illuminate the animal through the
    > scope, allowing you to see it through objects.

-   Shoot the animal with the Tranq Rifle or use Warframe abilities to
    > subdue it. Activate it to capture it.

**Rewards**

Each successful capture will award a Tag from each animal, and an amount
of Solaris United Standing depending on Capture Rating. 5 Tags of one
species can be traded in to The Business to receive stuffed animal
decorations, also known as Floofs. Having one tag of every species and
type can be traded for an emblem.

**Capture Rating**

Each capture will be rated as Perfect, Good, or Bad. This does not
influence Tags gained, but will influence Standing. Capture rating is
based on speed at which animal is captured after return call is
received, and whether or not the animal was alerted to your presence.

**Animal Types**

-   Pobbers - \"Native to the fungal forests of Venus, the Pobber is a
    > skittish rodent possessed of an objectionable odor. Always found
    > in groups, they flee at the slightest hint of trouble. They are a
    > primary food source for the Virmink and Sawgaw.\"

-   Virminks - \"Sleek and silky, the adorable appearance of the
    > Venusian Virmink belies its aggressive demeanor. Favoring rocky
    > landscapes Virmink packs nose the air, scenting for Pobbers -
    > their primary food source.\"

-   Sawgaws - "Soar Gore, as the Solaris call it, this crimson-faced
    > bird of prey circles and stalks the cliffs and fungal groves of
    > Venus, searching for rodent prey."

-   Bolarolas - \"Favoring thunder, lightning and cratered-out areas
    > Bolarolas are all about defense. Their armored plates protect them
    > from most predators, tucking-and-rolling to make good their
    > escape.

-   Horrasques - "This hideous creature is terrible to behold but will
    > not attack unless provoked. When it does, its roar will shake the
    > bowels of even the most steadfast tracker."

-   Stover - \"The Stover is a kind of proto-Kubrow that resurrected
    > when Venus thawed. When grouped in a pack, Stovers are relentless
    > opponents.\"

-   Kubrodons - \"The apex predator of the Venusian plains. These
    > massively framed beasts travel in groups and mark the territory
    > surrounding Orokin cooling towers as their own. Kubrodons are a
    > danger best avoided.\"

**Notes**

-   Animals can be killed, and will not provide any Standing or tags if
    > they are.

### Kit Guns

Kit Guns are the modular weapons of Fortuna, similar to Zaws in Cetus.
Kit Gun parts blueprints are offered by Rude Zuud for Solaris United
Standing. New parts are available as Solaris United rank is increased.
Kit Guns are made from 3 parts; Chamber, Grip, and Loader.

Kit Gun Chambers will provide 3k MR each. Like Zaws, Kit Guns must be
Gilded to gain MR. Gilding is available to any Kit Gun that has been
maxed at level 30, and costs 5k Standing and 10 Shelter Debt-Bonds.
Gilding also allows you to rename your Kit Gun. Unguilded Kit Guns
cannot have Potatoes, Formas, or Arcanes installed on them.

### K-Drive & Ventkids

K- Drives are hoverboard vehicles that were added in the Fortuna Update.
These K-Drives are slower than Archwing, so if you're looking for the
best mobility vehicle go with Archwing. That being said, K-Drives are
one of the most fun ways to kill time in *Warframe*.

Q: How do I get a K-Drive?

A: Once you complete the initial Fortuna quest Vox Solaris you will
receive a K-Drive Launcher. You will be able to equip this in your gear
wheel. Once it is equipped in your gear wheel you should be able to
launch a K-Drive in both open world areas.

Q: Where do I get more K-Drives?

Q: How do I get Ventkid standing?

A: The Ventkids can be accessed after completing Vox Solaris. Their main
vendor is Roky. Ventkid standing is earned by completing tricks in the
Vallis or by winning races found on the map. The standing can then be
used to buy K-Drive parts and mods. A K-Drive is made up of four parts;
a board, reactor, nose, and jet. These must be crafted then brought to
and assembled by Roky. Boards with random parts can alternatively be
bought already completed for Platinum.

Q: Do K-Drive parts matter?

A: Parts do not have any impact on how the K-Drive performs. Only the
board matters as it provides MR.

Q: Can I level up my K-Drive?

Q: Do K-Drives get MR?

A: Yes, the board of a K-Drive is what earns MR, a maximum of 3k per
board. K-Drives receive affinity from doing tricks and completing races
on the Vallis, and like all other pieces of equipment, can level to 30.

Q: Can I mod my K-Drive?

A: Yes, all K-Drive mods can be bought from Roky for standing. The
K-Drive itself can be modded in your Arsenal's vehicle section.

### Orb Mother Hunting

Orb Mothers are giant Corpus Raknoids that protect key operational
sites. They are the raid boss fight of the Orb Vallis, similar to
Eidolons. There are currently two, the Profit-Taker Orb that can be
found at the Enrichment Labs, and the Exploiter Orb that patrols around
the Temple of Profit. Only the Profit-Taker can currently be fought.

In order to fight the Profit-Taker, you must first be at the rank of Old
Mate with Solaris United. From there, you go to the hidden back room
behind Eudico to receive the Heist bounty missions. There are 4 bounties
currently, that must be completed subsequently. The fourth bounty is
fighting the Profit-Taker itself. After completing all 4 once, you may
go back and play them again in any order to receive their drop rewards.

The third bounty awards the Gravimag System, which is a gear item that
allows you to equip one primary Archwing weapon while in missions. The
Gravimag may be equipped to only one weapon, and is not cycleable. The
weapon must have an Orokin Catalyst equipped to equip the Gravimag.
Archwing weapons are the only weapons that can damage the Orb. The
Gravimag must be equipped in your gear wheel to use in missions.

Additional Gravimags can be researched and purchased in the Tenno Lab in
Clan Dojos, or bought from the Market for 20p.

Procedure:

1.  Find Profit-Taker on the Orb Vallis map.

2.  Take out shields using displayed element(s) (See below).

3.  Completely damage all 4 legs with Archwing weapon.

4.  Damage the head with Archwing weapon.

5.  At 75% health, the Orb will launch 4 pylons into the ground around
    > itself, within 100m. The pylons are protected by a physical
    > barrier that nullifies all gunfire, but can be passed through with
    > no effect.

6.  Destroy all pylons, Orb is invulnerable while pylons are intact.

7.  Take out shield and legs again, continue to damage head.

8.  At 50% health, the Orb will fully regain its shields and will deal
    > more damage.

9.  Take out shield, take out legs, damage the head.

10. At 25% health, the Orb will deploy 6 pylons with the same properties
    > as the previous 4.

11. Once the 6 pylons are destroyed, the Orb will fully regain its
    > shields again.

12. Take out shield, take out legs, destroy the head and defeat the Orb.
    > This step must be completed in 5 minutes or less.

13. The Orb overcharges from its shielding satellite, and self
    > destructs, instantly downing anything in a 300m radius. Run to a
    > safe distance then return to collect drops. There is a delay of
    > one minute between defeating the Orb and its self destruction.

The Orb Mother's shields have a unique damaging procedure, due to
Sentient resistance. The shields can be damaged by any regular weapon;
normal, Archwing, or Exalted, but cannot be damaged by True or Void
damage. Displayed on the Orb's front faceplate will be a symbol of a
specific damage type. The shield will be invulnerable to all damage
except the displayed damage type. The type encompasses all physical and
elemental damage, but does not include Void or True damage. This
includes dual elemental types. Keep in mind that dual elemental types
will not work if a single element is displayed, even if the single
element is included in the dual element. For example, if the displayed
element is toxin, then the shield will only be damaged by toxin, not
corrosive or gas or viral.

The shield damage type can be changed in 3 ways. If enough damage is
dealt from one damage type, the Orb will rapidly shift to another.
Shooting the Orb with any type of Void damage, Amp or otherwise, will
change the damage type. There is a cooldown of 10 seconds after using
this method before the type can be changed again. If enough time passes
without either of these changes, the damage type will change by itself.

Warframe abilities that target or deal AOE damage do not affect the
Orb's shields or body whatsoever. This includes Mesa's Peacemaker,
Banshee's Soundquake, Saryn's Miasma, etc. Warframe abilities that are
weaponized do work, such as Excalibur's Exalted Blade, Titania's Dex
Pixia, and Ivara's Artemis Bow. This can be used as an advantage, as
these weapons can hold additional damage types. Warframe
abilities/augments that provide damage buffs, such as Rhino's Roar and
Chroma's Vex Armor, work against the Orb. Warframe abilities/augments
that apply status effects to allies' weapons, such as Saryn's Spores or
Frost's Freeze, do work in providing additional elemental damage types
against the shield.

It should be noted that the Profit-Taker will summon Corpus
reinforcement to help defend itself. These enemies will move and attack
around the Profit-Taker, and will put up reinforcement beacons as
normal. The enemies range from level 40-60 and should be dealt with
regularly.

### Amps (SPOILERS)

See [[Plains of Eidolons Amps]{.underline}](#amps-spoilers) for general
information on Amps.

Upon completing Vox Solaris, the player will unlock a secret backroom
behind Eudico's chair. This is the same room where the Profit-Taker
bounties are found. Here you can talk to Little Duck in Operator form to
view Vox Solaris standing, trade Toroids for Standing, and purchase
Operator cosmetic blueprints, Arcanes, and Amp parts.

With the Profit-Taker update, Vox Solaris added 3 new Amp Prisms,
Scaffolds, and Braces.

**Amp Prisms**

  **Tier**   **Name**   **Description**

Other Resources and Information
===============================

Twitch Prime
------------

By connecting your Twitch Prime account to your *Warframe* account, you
will periodically receive Twitch rewards for *Warframe* in the form of
free gear and items. In addition, during scheduled *Warframe* streams,
you can receive a Twitch Drop or randomly selected reward if you watch
while signed into your connected accounts.

Prime Access
------------

Prime Access occurs whenever a Warframe's Prime variant is revealed.
This typically happens every 4 months. Prime Access brings with it the
new Primed Warframe, new Primed weapons, and new Primed cosmetic items.
The Warframe and weapon parts are added to the current relic drop
tables, and the Prime Access pack becomes available for purchase with
real currency.

The Prime Access pack always comes in 4 different levels:

-   Level 1 includes the two new Prime weapons, and 1050p

> (\$49.99 USD, \$100 value)

-   Level 2 includes the new Prime Warframe, both Prime weapons, two
    > glyphs of the Primed Warframe, and 2625p

> (\$79.99 USD, \$205 value)

-   Level 3 includes the new Prime Warframe, both prime weapons, two
    > glyphs of the Primed Warframe, 3990p, and the Prime Accessories
    > Pack (see below)

> (139.99 USD, \$380 value)

-   The Prime Accessories Pack includes a new Primed Syandana/Sugatra, a
    > new Primed Armor Set or Operator Armor Set, a 90 day affinity
    > booster and a 90 day credit booster.

> (\$49.99 USD, \$110 value)

Note that while the weapons and Warframes are in the drop tables and do
not require purchase to attain, the glyphs and cosmetics in the Access
Pack are unique to it and can only be obtained by purchasing the correct
level of the Pack.

Once a level of Prime Access is purchased, you may return and buy
additional levels at the cost they would be in total. For example, if
you bought the level 1 pack for \$49,99, then returned to buy the level
2 pack, the level 2 pack would cost \$29.99 instead of \$79.99, and
would not include the items and Plat that were already in the level 1
pack.

About
=====

This handbook is written with the new or returning player in mind, but
can be used by any Tenno, old or new. It's design is to give the need to
know/good to know information with as little fluff as possible. It's
purpose is for quick information access, instead of sifting through
pages of Wiki articles or long drawn out YouTube videos.\
\
The Warframe Handbook was originally created and written by DapperMuffin
back in the early days of *Warframe*. After some sharing around Reddit,
it became the most used and accessed unofficial guide for *Warframe*.
Around 2016, *Warframe* server outages began popping up in Muffin's
area, and he wasn't able to access the game. Since then the old Warframe
Handbook hasn't been updated, but was still seen by hundreds of players
every day.\
\
In mid-2018, Je2ture gained creative rights from DapperMuffin to revise
the old Handbook to match the current game build. After some initial
editing and updating, he recruited help from his clan, ZER0 TW0, who
helped him finish it. It was then released for public viewing in early
December of 2018, with an able team behind it ready to update as
needed.\
\
Today, the Warframe Handbook remains the most used unofficial text guide
for Warframe. We hope you find it useful, and pass it on to your friends
and fellow players. From all of us here on the team, we wish you happy
farming, Tenno!
